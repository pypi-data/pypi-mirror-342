# AI.zymes

Welcome to the code repository for **AI.zymes — a modular platform for evolutionary enzyme design**.

**AI.zymes** integrates a suite of state-of-the-art tools for enzyme engineering, including:
- 🛠️ **Protein design** (e.g. RosettaDesign, ProteinMPNN, LigandMPNN)  
- 🔮 **Structure prediction** (e.g. ESMFold, RosettaRelax, MD minimization)
- ⚡ **Electrostatic Catalysis** (e.g. FieldTools)

Built with modularity in mind, **AI.zymes** allows you to easily plug in new methods or customize workflows for diverse bioengineering goals — from enzyme evolution to structure-function exploration.

We are currently working on improving the accessibility of **AI.zymes**, including a full user manual and installation instructions. Stay tuned!

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

**AI.zymes** is currently not distributed as a Python package (e.g. via `pip`). To use the platform in your own scripts or Jupyter notebooks, you need to ensure the source directory is included in your Python module search path.

Add the following line to your `.bashrc` (or `.bash_profile`) to permanently include the source directory:

```
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/AIzymes/src"
```

This ensures that Python can locate modules like AIzymes_015.py when importing:

```
from AIzymes_015 import *
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace $HOME/AIzymes/src with the actual path if you have cloned the repository elsewhere.

> *AI.zymes is in active development! Contributions, feedback, and collaborations are very welcome! We are happy to assist you with geting AI.zymes to run on your systems.*
