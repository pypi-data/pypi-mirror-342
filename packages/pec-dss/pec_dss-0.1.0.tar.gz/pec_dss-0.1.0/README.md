**Paralinguistic Event Classification from Diarized Speaker Segments**

PEC-DSS is an advanced audio analysis system that identifies paralinguistic vocal events (like laughter, sighs, etc.) and attributes them to specific speakers through sophisticated speaker diarization and neural audio processing.

## ✨ Features

* 🎙️ Advanced speaker identification using neural audio encoders
* 😀 Attribution of paralinguistic events to specific speakers
* 🔍 High-accuracy SNAC (Scalable Neural Audio Codec) model integration
* 🔊 Voice embedding and similarity-based speaker matching
* 📊 Comprehensive audio codebook analysis
* 🔄 Modular architecture for easy customization

## 🚀 Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install pec-dss
```

### From Source with pip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hwk06023/PEC-DSS.git
cd PEC-DSS
pip install -e .
```

### From Source with requirements.txt

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hwk06023/PEC-DSS.git
cd PEC-DSS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## 📖 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from snac_model import load_snac_model
from audio_encoder import get_codebook_vectors
from speaker_identification import assign_speakers_to_laughs
import librosa

# Load SNAC model
snac_model = load_snac_model(device="cpu")  # or "cuda" for GPU

# Prepare speaker reference samples
speaker_samples = {
    "speaker1": [audio1, audio2],  # Audio waveforms as numpy arrays
    "speaker2": [audio3, audio4]
}

# Process unidentified audio events
unidentified_events = [event1, event2]  # Audio waveforms as numpy arrays

# Identify speakers for each audio event
results = assign_speakers_to_laughs(speaker_samples, unidentified_events, snac_model)

# Print results
for speaker, events in results.items():
    print(f"Speaker {speaker} has {len(events)} attributed events")
```

## 🧩 System Architecture

PEC-DSS consists of the following components:

* **snac_model.py**: SNAC model initialization and management
* **audio_encoder.py**: Audio encoding and vectorization
* **codebook_analysis.py**: Statistical analysis of audio codebooks
* **speaker_identification.py**: Speaker identification algorithms
* **main.py**: Integration and execution framework

## 🔊 Audio Event Types

The system can identify various paralinguistic events including:

* Laughter
* Sighs
* Crying
* Coughing
* Other non-verbal vocal expressions

## 🚀 Future Developments

* 🧠 Integration with more audio encoder models
* 😢 Expanded paralinguistic event recognition
* 🎵 Emotional tone classification
* ⚡ Performance optimization for real-time processing
