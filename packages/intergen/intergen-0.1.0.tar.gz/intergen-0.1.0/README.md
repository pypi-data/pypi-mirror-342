# INTERGEN: Interactive Neural Generalization

INTERGEN is a novel ensemble learning framework that allows multiple neural networks to interact and synthesize their weights based on performance metrics like R².

## Features
- Neural-to-neural interaction
- R²-based weight fusion
- Visualization support (heatmap, violin plot, bar plot)
- Modular architecture

## Installation

## Usage
Check out `demo.py` for an example.
