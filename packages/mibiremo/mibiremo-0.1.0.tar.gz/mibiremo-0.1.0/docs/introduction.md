# Introduction

## General

MiBiReMo (Microbiome Bioremediation Reaction Module) is a Python interface to the PhreeqcRM library. The package is designed to be coupled with transport models to simulate reactive transport in porous media, with applications in environmental and geochemical engineering.

## MIBIREM

[MIBIREM - Innovative technological toolbox for bioremediation](https://www.mibirem.eu/) is a EU funded consortium project by 12 international partners all over Europe working together to develop an *Innovative technological toolbox for bioremediation*. The project will develop molecular methods for the monitoring, isolation, cultivation and subsequent deposition of whole microbiomes. The toolbox will also include the methodology for the improvement of specific microbiome functions, including evolution and enrichment. The performance of selected microbiomes will be tested under real field conditions. The `mibipret` package is part of this toolbox.
