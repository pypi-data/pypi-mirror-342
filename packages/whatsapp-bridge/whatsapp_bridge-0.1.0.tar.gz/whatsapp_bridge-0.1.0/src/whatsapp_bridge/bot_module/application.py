    def run_polling(self) -> None:
        """
        Starts the main polling loop to fetch and process new messages.

        This method initializes the WhatsApp client, determines the starting
        timestamp for fetching messages (based on the latest message recorded
        in the database), and then enters a continuous loop to poll for new
        messages. Each incoming message is wrapped in an :class:`Update` object
        and subsequently dispatched to registered :class:`TypeHandler` and
        :class:`MessageHandler` instances whose filters match the update.

        The loop includes mechanisms to handle unexpected termination of the
        underlying Go bridge process by attempting to reinitialize the client
        and reconnect. Basic error handling and logging are implemented to
        monitor the polling process and handler execution. The polling loop
        continues until it is explicitly stopped (e.g., by a KeyboardInterrupt)
        or a critical error occurs that prevents further operation.

        Raises
        ------
        DbError
            If an error occurs while attempting to retrieve the latest message
            timestamp from the database during initialization or reconnection.
        BridgeError
            If an error related to the Go bridge connection occurs during the
            polling cycle or during attempts to reinitialize the client.
        ApiError
            If an error occurs during an API call made to the Go bridge
            while fetching messages or reinitializing the client.
        WhatsappPkgError
            For other package-specific errors encountered during the polling
            process or client reinitialization.
        KeyboardInterrupt
            If the polling loop is interrupted by the user, typically via
            a signal like Ctrl+C.
        Exception
            For any other unexpected errors that occur within the main polling loop.
