A simple flashcards program used to, among other things, learn another
language.  Flash cards are saved in a local file.  The file has the form:

word1 | definition1 | tally1
word2 | definition2 | tally2
           ...
wordN | definitionN | tallyN

Tally is the number of times the user correctly knew the definition of a word
without a miss. Tally is reset to zero (the default) anytime the user did not
rememember the definition.

Once the maximum tally value has been reached (default is 10), the word is
removed from the card set.  To run the program, run the go() function.
The go() function shuffles the cards before presenting cards to the user.

This program is meant to be run using python's interactive command-line
terminal (i.e. read-eval-print loop (REPL) terminal).  This comes standard when
python is installed on your PC.

    Flashcardz' settings are saved in a memory location named settings.  If you
    type in the name "settings" at the python prompt you will see its contents.
    For example:

        >>> settings

           {'pathname': C://Users//Ken//Documents//spanish//flashcardz.txt',
            'maxtally': 10,
            'tallypenalty': 10,
            'show_intro': True
            'replace_tabs': -1,
            'abort': False,
            'columns': 3,
            'col_width': 0,
            'wr': 'https://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=<word>',
            'wiki': 'https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/<word>#Spanish',
            'pronounce': 'https://www.howtopronounce.com/search/spanish/<word>'}

    In the python computer language, this is known as a "dictionary".  Items in
    a dictionary are in pairs: a key and its value (key: value).  If you wanted
    to add a new key named rae, and its value, you would do this:

        >>> settings['rae'] = 'https://dle.rae.es/correr'

    This will, when using the go() or cards() functions, open up the website
    named dle.rae.es and show the definition of the Spanish word "correr".
    However, obviously, you would not want to restrict yourself to just one
    word.  To make go() and cards() show the word that is currently active, do
    this instead:

        >>> settings['rae'] = 'https://dle.rae.es/<word>'

    That is, when the text <word> is present, the program will replace <word>
    with the currently active word.

    Most likely you will want to choose your own key word and own value.  To do
    this search for a word on the site of the dictionary you want to use.  Copy
    the url that shows up in address bar.  For example, if you look for the word
    "family" on Merriam-Webster's web site, and after you copied and pasted the
    url, it will look like this:  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/family.
    Now, if you want to add this to your settings, you would do this:

        >>> setting['web'] = 'https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/<word>'

    Make sure you add the quote marks.  The key doesn't have to be 'web'.  It
    can be anything you like.  To make this setting permanent, i.e. so that it
    will be available after you close and later reopen flashcardz, do this:

        >>> save_settings()

    If at some point you decide you no longer want the key and its value
    present, do this:

        >>> del settings['web']

    Make sure to do a save_settings() to make your changes permanent.  If you
    mess up your settings so that flashcardz doesn't work properly, delete your
    settings file and restart flashcardz.  The file will be recreated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    word : string
        New word to add to the deck of cards.  (A string, by the way, in python
        is text surrounded by quotation marks, e.g. 'house (noun)'; though
        triple quotes works and at times aids in the task of adding and editing
        cards. i.e. '''house (noun)''').

        If a word is found to already exist (exact same letters) then the
        definition of that word is replaced by the new definition that you
        enter.

    definition : string
        Definition of the word.  Surround your string with quotation marks.  If
        your string is multiline, surround your string with triple quotes, e.g.:
        ''' a building that serves as living quarters for one or a few
        families; a shelter, refuge.'''

        URL links can be included within a description.  URL links must have
        the form [some text](a url).  For example, a description which includes
        a URL link will look like: '''blah blah blah
        [connect to google](https://www.google.com/) blah blah'''.  See
        help(go) and help(cards) to see how a user is to activate these links.
        (If you have trouble setting up links, see 'Notes' in
        help(modify_text).)

        You can have portions of your text highlighted with italics,
        underlined, or have a different color text such as red or green.  To
        learn how to do this, read the doumentation at an internal function
        that flashcardz utilizes by entering: help(modify_text)

    tally : int
        Set the tally to a value you choose. Normally let the program set
        this value for you.  Tally is automaticaly set to 0 when you enter a
        new word and definition.  If the word you enter already exists, then
        tally is set to value of that word.  However you can override any of
        these automatic settings by entering a value that you deem suitable.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> add('taza nf', '(bol con asa)  cup n, mug n')


    #  When go() is run, word and desription will show as:
    #
    #    taza nf
    #

    >>> add(w, d)


    #  Using w and d as shown above is another way to achieve the same result.
    #
    #  Tip 1: If the definition you entered isn't to your satifaction, push the

    #  board's arrow keys.
    #
    #  Tip 3: It is recommended to use python 3.13 or greater.  However,on

    Parameters
    ----------
    i (optional) : None | int | float
        if type(i) == None, that is, if you enter no value, i.e. you enter
            cards(), then a list of all cards, without word definitions, is
            shown.
        if type(i) == int (i.e. integer); then show the word at index position
            i along with its definition. (Do "cards()" to see index numbers
            that correspond to words.)
        if type(i) == int, and i < 0, then show both word and defintion at
           postition i; and also expose coding within the description so that
           embeded urls, and color/underline/italics codes can be seen.
           (See help(modify_text) to see how how to add color, etc. to text.
           See help(add), to see how to embed urls.)
        if type(i) == float and -1 < i < 0, then at card 0 expose coding
           within the description so that embeded urls, and
           color/underline/italics codes can be seen.

    j (optional): None | int | list
        if type(j) == None, that it, if the user leaves this blank, then the
            j argument does nothing.
        if type(j) == int, then show a list of words starting at i (the first
            argument) and ending at j.  Furthermore, if (j - i) <= 10, then
            definitions will be shown.
        if type(j) == list, and the list contains an interger, e.g. [1],
            [2], etc., then open a web page for the 1st, 2nd, url link that is
            within the descriptions.  (See the add() function's documentation
            for how to insert url's into definitions.)  If more that one number
            is present, then open multiple urls.  E.g. [1, 2]
        if type(j) == string, and string is the keyword 'wr', 'wiki', or
            'pronounce'... keywords found in flashcardz' settings, then open up
            the webpage wordreference.com, en.wiktionary.org, or
            howtopronounce.com repectively and show the definition of the word
            from those sites.  Open up more than one page at a time by

def modify_text(text):
    """This is an internal function of flashcardz.  It facilitates the user to
    insert ansi escape codes into his text.  This then allows the user to show
    selected text underlined, italicized, and/or colored.  For example, if a
    word description is "my long, lengthy description", and the user adds
    special coding within it like "my long, <g>lengthy<> description", then the
    text "lengthy" will be shown with green letters to the user.

    The keys that may be used to alter text are:
    k=black, r=red, g=green, y=yellow, b=blue, p=purple, c=cyan, w=white
    i=italics, 1=bold, u=underline, x=cross out.

    Making text bold (code "1") makes colors brighter.

    Background colors to text can also be added.  Background color keys are:
    K=black, R=red, G=green, Y=yellow, B=blue, P=purple, C=cyan, W=white

    More than one code can be entered at a time, for example
    "my long, <g1ui>lengthy<> description" will make "lengthy" bright green,
    underlined, and with italicized text.

    As you will have already noticed, the syntax is:
    <code letters>text to modify<>

    Note:  Altering text as described above may not work on your system.  It
    depends on whether your operating system, the version of your operating
    system, and/or whether your console supports it or not.  With Python 3.13
    it seems to work fine.  Also, you can load an additional package called
    ipython.  Ipython works fine with this text altering.  To install ipython
    do "pip install ipython" (w/o quotes).  Here are urls to help you get
    started learning about ipython:
    1.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WFQ5MUA27U
    2.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TneKbjhcPic
    3.  https://www.stephaniehicks.com/learnPython/pages/IPython.html

    Parameters
    ----------
    text : string
        The text to alter.  The text can include the codes that are to alter
        the text.

    Returns
    -------
    text : string
        Returns the same text that was input to the function, but ansi escape
        codes will replace the user supplied codes.  Witn ansi escape codes,
        text will look like \x1b[0;3;1m\\x1b[0;32mtext to modify\\x1b[0m\x1b[0m.  (The user will
        never see this code.)  In this example, the text will be shown green.
        If the user entered no code, then the text remains unchanged.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> modify_text('''(moverse deprisa)
