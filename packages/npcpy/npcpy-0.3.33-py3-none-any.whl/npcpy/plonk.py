    You can choose from the following action types:
    {json.dumps(action_space)}



    Attached to the message is a screenshot of the current screen.

    Please use that information to determine the next steps.
    Your response must be a JSON with an 'actions' key containing a list of actions.
    Each action should have a 'type' and any necessary parameters.https://www.reddit.com


    For example:
        Your response should look like:

    A user asked the following question: {request}

    You are in charge of creating a plonk plan that will handle their request.
    This plonk plan will be a series of steps that you will write that will be
    used to generate a fully functioning system that will accomplish the user's request.
    your plonk plan should be a python script that generates LLM prompts
    that will be used to generate the distinct pieces of software.

    The goal here is modularization, abstraction, separation of scales.
    A careful set of instructions can pave the way for a system that can be iterated on
    and improved with successive steps.

    Here is an example of a question and answer that you might generate:

    Question: "Set up an automation system that will open a web browser every morning
        and go to my bank account and export my transactions."

    Answer:
    "{{'plonk plan': ```

from npcpy.llm_funcs import get_llm_response

automation_script = get_llm_response( '''
    Write a python script that will request input from a user about what bank they use. Then use selenium to open the browser and navigate to the bank's website.
    Get the user's username and password and log in, also through raw input.
    Then navigate to the transactions page and export the transactions. Ensure you are sufficiently logging information at each step of the way so that the results can be
    debugged efficiently.
    Return the script without any additional comment or Markdown formatting. It is imperative that you do not include any additional text.
''')
# write the automation script to a file
automation_script_file = open('automation_script.py', 'w')
automation_script_file.write(automation_script)
automation_script_file.close()


scheduling_script = get_llm_response( f'''
    Write a bash script that will set up an OS scheduler to run the automation script every morning at 8 am.
    The automation script is located at ./automation_script.py.
    You'll need to ensure that the full path is used in the scheduling script.
    Return the script without any additional comment or Markdown formatting.
    It is imperative that you do not include any additional text.
    Do not leave any placeholder paths or variables in the script.
    They must be able to execute without
    any further modification by you or the user.
    ''')
# write the scheduling script to a file
scheduling_script_file = open('scheduling_script.sh', 'w')
scheduling_script_file.write(scheduling_script)

scheduling_script_file.close()
# attempt to run the scheduling script
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['bash', 'scheduling_script.sh'])
```}}

    In this example, we have set up a plan that will require multiple other LLM calls to generate the necessary items to
    accomplish the user's request.
