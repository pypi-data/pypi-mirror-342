Interpret and Extract Project Management Information:

# Primary Extraction Categories
- Project Status: Extract current progress state, completion levels, and overall status.
- Task Management: Identify tasks with their priorities, dependencies, statuses, and deadlines.
- Decision Records: Document decisions, their rationale, implications, and related constraints.
- Resource Allocation: Capture information about resource usage, assignments, and availability.
- Risk Assessment: Identify potential risks, their impact ratings, and mitigation strategies.
- Technical Artifacts: Extract technical specifications, dependencies, and implementation notes.

# Memory Structure and Templates
- Use the following templates to structure your input:
  - Project Status: Track overall project progress and current focus. Mandatory Fields: `name`, `purpose`. Optional Fields: `version`, `phase`, `completionLevel`, `milestones`, `currentFocus`.
  - Task Management: Manage task priorities, statuses, and dependencies. Mandatory Fields: `description`, `status`. Optional Fields: `deadline`, `assignee`, `dependencies`.
  - Decision Records: Document decisions, their rationale, implications, and constraints. Mandatory Fields: `topic`, `selected`, `rationale`. Optional Fields: `options`, `implications`, `constraints`, `responsible`, `stakeholders`.
  - Resource Allocation: Capture information about resource usage, assignments, and availability. Mandatory Fields: None. Optional Fields: `team`, `infrastructure`, `budget`.
  - Risk Assessment: Identify potential risks, their impact ratings, and mitigation strategies. Mandatory Fields: `description`, `impact`, `probability`. Optional Fields: `mitigation`, `owner`, `monitoringItems`.
  - Technical Artifacts: Extract technical specifications, dependencies, and implementation notes. Mandatory Fields: None. Optional Fields: `architecture`, `technologies`, `standards`.
- Refer to the 'Memory Structure and Templates' section in the documentation for detailed descriptions and examples.

# Metadata Extraction (when available)
- Temporal Context: Extract timestamps, durations, deadlines, and sequence information.  Format dates and times using ISO 8601 format.
- Project Context: Identify project names, phases, domains, and scope indicators.
- Relationship Mapping: Extract relationships between extracted elements, such as:
  - 'relatedTo': Elements that are related to each other (bidirectional).
  - 'enables': Element A enables element B (directional).
  - 'blockedBy': Element A is blocked by element B (directional).
  - 'dependsOn': Element A depends on element B (directional).
  - Relationships should be extracted as strings or arrays of strings.

# Interpretation Guidelines
- For structured input (JavaScript/JSON objects): Preserve the structural hierarchy while enriching with contextual metadata, and extract key-value pairs.
- For code-structured representations: Analyze both the structural patterns (e.g., variable names, function names, class names) and the semantic content (e.g., comments, descriptions, code logic).
- For mixed-format input: Prioritize semantic content while acknowledging structural hints (e.g., headings, lists, tables). Extract information from text, code snippets, and structured data blocks.

# Output Structure Formation
- Extracted information should be categorized according to the Primary Extraction Categories.
- Preserve original identifiers and reference keys (e.g., project name, task ID) for continuity.
- When metadata such as project name and timestamp are not explicitly provided as top-level keys, attempt to infer them from the context (e.g., from comments).
- The output should be a JSON object with the following structure:
  {
    "category": "string",  // Primary Extraction Category (e.g., "Task Management")
    "content": "any",      // Extracted content (e.g., task details)
    "metadata": "object",  // Extracted metadata (e.g., {"project": "ProjectA", "deadline": "2023-12-01"})
    "relationships": "array"  // Extracted relationships (e.g., [{"type": "dependsOn", "target": "TaskB"}])
  }
  // Note: The current implementation of get_all_project_memories and search_project_memories returns a
  // flattened list of strings. This output structure is a future goal and may require changes to those tools.

Update an existing project memory with new content.

This tool updates a memory identified by its ID. Ideal for smaller changes
where maintaining the memory's ID and creation timestamp is important.

Guidelines for choosing update vs. delete+create:
- Use UPDATE when: making minor changes, preserving references is critical
- Consider DELETE+CREATE when: completely restructuring content
- When unsure: start with update, and if structural issues occur, fall back to delete+create

IMPORTANT NOTE: While `add_project_memory` might sometimes update existing entries 
based on internal matching logic, `update_project_memory` ensures explicit and 
intentional updates to specific entries. Use this tool when you need guaranteed
updates to an exact memory entry with full control over the process.

Args:
    memory_id: The unique identifier of the memory to update
    text: The new content for the memory

Returns:
    dict: The updated memory object with complete metadata

Example usage:
    ```

    # 2. From the results, identify the ID of the memory to update
