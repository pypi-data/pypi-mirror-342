# LeafLux

## About
LeafLux is a process based light dynamics model for forested environments. The goal 
of LeafLux is to provide relative irradiance information for a user provided
canopy and terrain at a finer resolution than is 
typically available. It is a Python package that aims to be easy to use and is
compatible with standard numpy data types.
