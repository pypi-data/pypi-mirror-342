# 👻 Post-Quantum Cryptography

In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers – machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.

## 💡 Purpose

This package provides tested, ergonomic **Python 3** CFFI bindings to implementations of a number of algorithms submitted as part of the [Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization) effort by [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/).

## 🚀 Installation

You can install PQCrypto using your package manager of choice.
Pre-compiled wheels are available for common platforms and Python versions.
If a pre-compiled wheel is not available for your platform or Python version, we recommend you build PQCrypto from source.

Using `uv`:
```bash
uv add pqcrypto
```

Using `poetry`:
```bash
poetry add pqcrypto
```

Using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pqcrypto
```

## 🔐 Key Encapsulation

```python
from secrets import compare_digest
from pqcrypto.kem.mceliece8192128 import generate_keypair, encrypt, decrypt

# Alice generates a (public, secret) key pair
public_key, secret_key = generate_keypair()

# Bob derives a secret (the plaintext) and encrypts it with Alice's public key to produce a ciphertext
ciphertext, plaintext_original = encrypt(public_key)

# Alice decrypts Bob's ciphertext to derive the now shared secret
plaintext_recovered = decrypt(secret_key, ciphertext)

# Compare the original and recovered secrets in constant time
assert compare_digest(plaintext_original, plaintext_recovered)
```

## ✒️ Signing

```python
from pqcrypto.sign.dilithium4 import generate_keypair, sign, verify

# Alice generates a (public, secret) key pair
public_key, secret_key = generate_keypair()

# Alice signs her message using her secret key
signature = sign(secret_key, b"Hello world")

# Bob uses Alice's public key to validate her signature
assert verify(public_key, b"Hello world", signature)
```
