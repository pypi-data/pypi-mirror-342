# PatANN - Pattern-Aware Vector Database / ANN

## Overview
PatANN is a pattern-aware, massively parallel, and distributed vector search framework designed for scalable and efficient nearest neighbor search, operating both in-memory and on-disk. Unlike conventional algorithms, PatANN leverages macro and micro patterns within vectors to drastically reduce search space before performing costly distance computations.

While still in beta, PatANN's pattern-first approach delivers unprecedented performance advantages. As shown in our benchmarks (Figure 1), PatANN consistently outperforms leading ANN libraries including HNSW (hnswlib), Google ScaNN, Facebook FAISS variants, and others in the critical recall-throughput tradeoff.

### Python API

PatANN supports both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) operation modes:

1. **Synchronous Mode**: Simple sequential operations, ideal for straightforward applications
2. **Asynchronous Mode**: High-throughput parallel operations with callbacks, ideal for production systems

## Platforms
- Linux
- macOS (Apple Silicon)
- Windows
- Android
- iOS

## Code Examples
Code examples for all platforms (Python, Kotlin, Java, Objective-C, Swift) in both asynchronous and synchronous modes are available at https://github.com/mesibo/patann
