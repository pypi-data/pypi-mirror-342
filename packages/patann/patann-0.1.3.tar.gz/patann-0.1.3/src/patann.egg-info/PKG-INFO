# PatANN - Pattern-Aware Vector Database and ANN Framework

## Overview
PatANN is a pattern-aware, massively parallel, and distributed vector search framework designed for scalable and efficient nearest neighbor search, operating both in-memory and on-disk. Unlike conventional algorithms, PatANN leverages macro and micro patterns within vectors to drastically reduce search space before performing costly distance computations.

Refer to the website for technical details, algorithm overview, key innovations, benchmarks, and tutorials.  

https://patann.dev

While still in beta, PatANN's pattern-first approach delivers unprecedented performance advantages. As shown in our benchmarks (Figure 1), PatANN consistently outperforms leading ANN libraries including HNSW (hnswlib), Google ScaNN, Facebook FAISS variants, and others in the critical recall-throughput tradeoff.
