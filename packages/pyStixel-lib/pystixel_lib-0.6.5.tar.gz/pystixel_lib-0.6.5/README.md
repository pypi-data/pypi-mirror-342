# pyStixel-lib
The Python Stixel Library is a versatile Python toolkit designed for advanced computer vision tasks.
It provides definitions, im-/exports and functions for stixelsâ€”vertical strips that represent depth
and scene structure in images. It also introduces the `.stx1` format as a protobuf export for Stixel Worlds, 
which contains the Stixel World, camera calibration parameters, and the corresponding image.

The basic functionality is to provide some objects and relative functions. The base for Stixel
operations is the Stixel World. The `util` package provide simple draw functions like:

Or an RGB supported 3D transformation with provided Camera matrix:
