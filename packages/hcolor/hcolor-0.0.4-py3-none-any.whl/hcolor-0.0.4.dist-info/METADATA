# hcolor - Color manipulation tool

The goal of this package is to provide a color manipulation tool for use in the Python environments.
The original intention was to bring mathematics to color space generation.

The package provides the `HColor` class, which represents a color by RGBA components, stored as
floats (0-to-1) and provides handy manipulation methods using the standard  `colorsys` library.

The main features of the HColor class are:

- instant cast to HTML color definition,
- creation from HSL parameters (hue/saturation/lightness),
- manipulation of HLS parameters,
- creation of color palettes as a series of HLS variations
- creation from HTML color definition (from string).

*To be further documented.*

For now, you can check the unit tests, since I focus there on testing the functionality that the
package provides.
