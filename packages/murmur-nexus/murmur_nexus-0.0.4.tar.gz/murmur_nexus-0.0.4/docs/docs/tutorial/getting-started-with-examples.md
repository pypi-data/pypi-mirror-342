# Tutorial: Getting Started with the Examples
By the end of this tutorial, youâ€™ll have built and published your own agent and tools, installed Murmur, and confirmed everything works by running the provided examples. Youâ€™ll be ready to create more advanced agents and tools using the same approach.

## Prerequisites
!!! warning "Do this first!"

    [How to: Setup your own PyPI server](../how-to/setup-pypi-server.md). Use it to host your own agents and tools.

## Install Murmur

1.	(Optional) Create and activate a python virtual environment:

```bash
mkdir murmur-artifacts
cd murmur-artifacts
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install `murmur-nexus` and `mur`, both are essential for running the examples. 

```bash
pip install 'murmur-nexus[langgraph,swarm]' mur
```

!!! note ""

    - **`murmur-nexus`**: Murmur enables the use of published agents and tools within your orchestration code.
    - **`mur`**: Mur is a command-line interface (CLI)for creating and managing agents and tools.

Verify the installation by running `mur --help`.

3. Done. To the moon! ðŸš€

!!! bug "Issues?"

    If during the installation process you experience any issues, please join our [:simple-discord: Discord](https://discord.gg/RGKCfD8HhC) and ask for help.

## Publish an Agent
1. Clone the [:simple-github: murmur-example-artifacts](https://github.com/murmur-nexus/murmur-example-artifacts/tree/main) repo into your workspace directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/murmur-nexus/murmur-example-artifacts.git
```

2. Build the `friendly-assistant` agent. Optionally edit the `murmur-build.yaml` file first.

```bash
cd murmur-example-artifacts/agents/friendly-assistant
mur build
```

You should see something like this:
![Docker Container Running](../assets/terminal-mur-build-friendly-assistant.png)
/// caption
Built for agent completed.
///

3.	Then simply run:

```bash
mur publish
```

!!! warning "Connection refused?"

    If you get a `Connection refused` error, it means either your PyPI server is not running or you didn't set the `MURMUR_INDEX_URL` environment variable in your current terminal session.

    ```bash
    export MURMUR_INDEX_URL=http://localhost:8080/simple
    ```
    
    To prevent re-setting the environment variable every time you open a new terminal session, add the above to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

4.	Youâ€™ve published your first agent ðŸŽ‰.

## Publish Tools
1. Build the `add` tool. Optionally edit the `murmur-build.yaml` file first. In the root project directory where `murmur-example-artifacts` resides (`cd ../../`) do:

```bash
cd tools/add
mur build
```

2.	Then run:

```bash
mur publish
```

3.	Youâ€™ve published your first tool ðŸ”¥.

4.	Repeat step 1 to 3 for publishing tools for `multiply`, `divide`, and `is_prime`. These are the minimum  required tools for testing the basic examples. 


## Install Agents and Tools
1. Go to your `/murmur-artifacts` directory (`cd ../../`) and clone the [:simple-github: murmur](https://github.com/murmur-nexus/murmur).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/murmur-nexus/murmur.git
```

2.	cd into the `examples/basic` directory.

```bash
cd murmur/examples/basic
```

3.	Open `murmur.yaml` and adjust names/versions if needed. Here is what the file should look like:

``` { .yaml .annotate title=examples/murmur.yaml }
name: examples-basic
version: 1.0.0
agents:
  - name: friendly-assistant
    version: 1.0.0
tools:
  - name: add
    version: 1.0.0
  - name: multiply
    version: 1.0.0
  - name: divide
    version: 1.0.0
  - name: is_prime
    version: 1.0.0 # (1)
```

1.  It's recommended to put a strict version for maximum control. 

---

Almost there! You just need to install requirements for using the examples.

4. Install the requirements.txt file. 

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

5. Create `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Get [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-aBCdeFg...
```

6.	Install all the agents and tools from `murmur.yaml`:

```bash
mur install
```
You should see something like this: ==Successfully installed all artifacts==.

5.	Execute an example. E.g. for LangGraph:

```bash
python langgraph_math.py
```

You just orchestrated your first agent and tools with Murmur! ðŸŽ‰

## Wrap Up
- You can now run the examples and build your own agents and tools.
- Star the [:simple-github: murmur](https://github.com/murmur-nexus/murmur) repo ðŸŒŸ and join our [:simple-discord: Discord](https://discord.gg/RGKCfD8HhC) to continue learning.
- Submit any [feature requests or bugs](https://github.com/murmur-nexus/murmur/issues); weâ€™d love your feedback.
