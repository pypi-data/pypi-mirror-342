title: "Custom Location Example"
description: "This page uses custom directory structure"
template:
  # If you just wrote this directly it would be relative to the templates directory
  # We want it to be relative to the config file, so use path:
  path: "../other_templates/custom_page.svg.j2"
detailed_description:
  "This example demonstrates custom file locations in pdfbaker. The template file is in
  a custom directory (other_templates/), the page configuration file is in another
  custom directory (other_pages/), and the document configuration uses a path-based page
  reference with custom location."
