### Developer Tools - splitends

Package implementing a singularly linked LIFO queue called a SplitEnd. These
data structures can safely share data nodes between themselves.

- *class* dtools.splitends.splitend.SE: Mutable LIFO queues (stacks)
  - which allow for data sharing between different instances
  - each splitend sees itself as a singularly linked list
    - from the "end" of the hair to its "root"
  - multiple instances can form bush like data structures
    - like follicles of hair with split ends
- *class* dtools.splitends.splitend_node
  - data nodes for SplitEnd stacks
