    "prico2": 0.02,
}
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Many parameters are optional depending on configuration. Refer to the full list of accepted keys in the docstring of the `__init__` method for more customization.

Create DirectOperatingCost Object and Run Calculations

```python
doc_calculator = DirectOperatingCost(aircraft=aircraft_data)

# Calculate DOC
doc_result = doc_calculator.calculate_doc()
for key, value in doc_result.items():
  print(f"{key}:\t{value}")

# Calculate IOC
ioc_result = doc_calculator.calculate_ioc()
for key, value in ioc_result.items():
  print(f"{key}:\t{value}")
```
---

To use the GEMSEO discipline, import the `GemseoDirectOperatingCost` class

```python
from doc_calculator import GemseoDirectOperatingCost
import numpy as np
```

Prepare Aircraft Input Dictionary. Make sure to use Numpy arrays.

```python
aircraft_data = {
    "adp": np.array([85]),            # Aircraft Delivery Price (USD M)
    "mtow": np.array([70]),           # Max Take-off Weight (Tonnes)
    "pld": np.array([18]),            # Payload (Tonnes)
    "mew": np.array([40]),            # Manufacturer Empty Weight (Tonnes)
    "bengw": np.array([1.2]),         # Bare engine weight (Tonnes)
    "enpri": np.array([6.5]),         # Engine Price (USD M)
    "en": np.array([2]),              # Number of engines
    "crewtech": np.array([2]),
    "crewc": np.array([4]),
    "bt": np.array([1.5]),            # Sector Block Time (Hours)
    "bf": np.array([2500]),           # Sector Block Fuel (KG)
    "sector": np.array([600]),        # Sector length (NM)

    # add all other required keys
}
```

Create the disciplne and Run Calculations

```python
doc_displine = GemseoDirectOperatingCost()

out = doc_displine.execute(input_data=aircraft_data)
```

---

To fully customize the analysis of aircraft operating costs the `Params` dataclass helps you modify typical unit rates, depending on the economic scenario

Import the class

```python
from doc_calculator.core.utils.params import Params
```

Modify economic assumptions and pass the object through the `params` keyword

```python
parameters = Params()
parameters.ENR = 85.0   # Unit Rate for the En-route Navigation Charge

# DirectOperatingCost
doc_calculator = DirectOperatingCost(aircraft=aircraft_data, params=parameters)

# GemseoDirectOperatingCost
doc_displine = GemseoDirectOperatingCost(params=parameters)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** See the `Params` class source code for all available unit rates and economic scenario constants
