# ‚úàÔ∏è doc_calculator

`doc_calculator` is a Python package designed to calculate **Direct Operating Costs (DOC)** and **Indirect Operating Costs (IOC)** for **short-haul** and **medium-haul** aircraft. It supports both **regional** and **large transport** categories, and includes modules for **hybrid-electric aircraft** configurations.

## üöÄ Features

- Compute **Direct Operating Costs (DOC)** and **Indirect Operating Costs (IOC)**
- Supports both **conventional** and **hybrid-electric** propulsion systems
- Cost modules for:
  - **Fuel**, **Electricity** and **Hydrogen** consumption
  - Financial costs anlsysis including **Depreciation**, **Interests** and **Insurance**
  - Charges and Fees:
    - Landing
    - Payload Handling
    - Navigation
    - Noise Emissions
    - CO Emissions
    - NOx Emissions
    - CO2 Emissions (EU ETS)
  - Maintenance costs for:
    - Airframe
    - Turboprop Engines
    - Propulsive Batteries
    - Fuel Cells
    - Electric Machines
    - Power Electronics
  - Crew Handling costs:
    - Pilots costs
    - Cabin Crew costs  

- The package includes a ready-to-use **GEMSEO discipline** to allow integration with multidisciplinary design analysis (MDA) and optimization (MDO) workflows based on the GEMSEO framework.
