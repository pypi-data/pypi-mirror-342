# About the name

Every month at work, I had to report to the head of my department how much time
was spent working on each project. This information would be collected from each employee and compiled into
"Internal Use Software" information. 

To be honest, I'm not sure what the higher-ups do with this information, but regardless, I figured I would track
the data accurately instead of making up BS numbers at the end of the month. 

Thus, the `ius-time` CLI application was born.

*TLDR: IUS = Internal Use Software*
