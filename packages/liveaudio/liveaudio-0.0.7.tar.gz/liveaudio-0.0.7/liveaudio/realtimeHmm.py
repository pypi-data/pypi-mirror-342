    """
    Optimized block-structured Viterbi algorithm for real-time applications.
    
    This function implements a forward-only Viterbi algorithm that takes advantage of sparse,
    Toeplitz transition matrices structured as a 2x2 block matrix. It applies the current
    observation probabilities and computes the next state probabilities, ready for the next call.
    
    Parameters:
    ----------
    value : np.ndarray
        Current log probabilities for each state.
    log_prob : np.ndarray
        Log probabilities of current observations for each state.
    log_trans_00 : np.ndarray
        Band of the transition matrix for group 0 → group 0 transitions.
        Should be of odd length (2*halfWidth + 1), centered at the diagonal.
    log_trans_01 : np.ndarray
        Band of the transition matrix for group 0 → group 1 transitions.
        Should be of odd length, centered at the correspondence point.
    log_trans_10 : np.ndarray
        Band of the transition matrix for group 1 → group 0 transitions.
        Should be of odd length, centered at the correspondence point.
    log_trans_11 : np.ndarray
        Band of the transition matrix for group 1 → group 1 transitions.
        Should be of odd length, centered at the diagonal.
    n1 : int
        Number of states in the first group (group 0).
    correspondence : np.ndarray
        Array mapping each state to its corresponding state in the other group.
        For indices 0 to n1-1 (group 0): contains local indices (0-based) in group 1.
        For indices n1 to n1+n2-1 (group 1): contains local indices (0-based) in group 0.
        Used to determine where to center the band for between-group transitions.
        The index into this array is the destination state (j), and the value 
        retrieved is the corresponding source state in the other group that serves
        as the center of the transition band.
        
    Returns:
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing:
        - max_vals: np.ndarray - The updated log probabilities for each state
        - result: int - The index of the most likely state after applying log_prob
    
    Notes:
    -----
    - The transition matrices are represented as bands to take advantage of their sparse
      Toeplitz structure, where transitions depend only on the distance between states.
    - For within-group transitions (00 and 11), the band is centered on the diagonal.
    - For between-group transitions (01 and 10), the band is centered on the corresponding
      state as defined by the correspondence array.
    - The half-width of each band is calculated as (len(band) - 1) // 2, so bands should
      have odd lengths for symmetric spanning around the center point.
    - The algorithm is optimized for Numba parallel execution.
    - This implementation is intended for situations where the range of states 
      in each group is the same, but at different resolutions.
