class LinearVolumeNormalizer:
    """
    A class for normalizing audio signals by applying a linear gain function.
    
    This normalizer maximizes volume of audio chunks by applying a linearly increasing 
    gain function while ensuring the signal never exceeds a specified amplitude limit.
    It's designed to be used with streaming audio by maintaining state between chunks.
    
    The normalizer works by finding the optimal linear gain function through constrained
    optimization. It balances maximizing overall signal volume while applying a penalty
    for exceeding the amplitude limit. For enhanced efficiency, the audio is segmented 
    into blocks and only the maximum value from each block is used for optimization.
    
    IMPORTANT: This normalizer cannot guarantee 100% that audio won't exceed the limit
    because it cannot change the first sample of the next chunk (as this would cause
    a discontinuity in the audio). For this reason, it's recommended to allow some 
    headroom by setting the limit below 1.0 (default is 0.95).
    
    Attributes:
        limit (float): Maximum absolute amplitude allowed in the normalized signal (0.0-1.0).
        v0 (float): Initial gain value for the first chunk; updated after each chunk.
        maxKT (float): Maximum allowed gain increase over the entire chunk.
        lmbda (float): Penalty factor for samples exceeding the limit.
        nBlocks (int): Number of blocks to divide the audio into for optimization.

        Initialize the LinearVolumeNormalizer with amplitude limit and starting gain.
        
        Parameters:
            limit (float): Maximum absolute amplitude allowed in the normalized signal, 
                          typically between 0.0 and 1.0. Default is 0.95.
            v0 (float): Initial gain value for the first chunk. Default is 0.95.
            maxKT (float): Maximum allowed gain increase over the entire chunk. Default is 0.2.
            lmbda (float): Penalty factor for samples exceeding the limit. Higher values enforce
                          stricter adherence to the limit. Default is 0.1.
            nBlocks (int): Number of blocks to divide the audio into for optimization. Default is 32.
                          Higher values provide more precision but slower performance.

    def normalize(self, x):
        """
        Normalize an audio chunk using an optimized linear gain function.
        
        This method uses JIT-compiled golden section search optimization to find the best
        linear gain increase that can be applied to the audio chunk. It maximizes overall 
        signal volume while applying a penalty for any sample exceeding the specified amplitude limit.
        
        For performance optimization, the audio is divided into blocks, and only the maximum value
        from each block is used in the optimization process.
        
        Parameters:
            x (numpy.ndarray): A 1D numpy array containing the audio samples to normalize.
                              Values are typically in the range [-1.0, 1.0].
                              
        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray: The normalized audio with the optimized linear gain function applied.
            
        Notes:
            - The gain function is calculated as: v(t) = v0 + k*t, where k is the slope
              of the gain function and t is the sample index.
            - The method handles various edge cases including empty arrays and arrays with all zeros.
            - After processing, v0 is updated to the ending gain value for continuity 
              with the next chunk.
