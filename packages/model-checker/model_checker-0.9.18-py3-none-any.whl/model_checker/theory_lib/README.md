# ModelChecker Theory Library

## Overview

The ModelChecker Theory Library is a collection of formal semantic theories implemented using Z3 constraint solving for logical reasoning. Each theory provides a programmatic implementation of a different semantic framework, enabling automated verification of logical arguments and discovery of countermodels.

The library follows a modular architecture that allows:

- Comparison between different semantic theories
- Extension with new theories
- Reuse of common components
- Standardized testing and evaluation

## Available Theories

The library currently includes the following theories:

### Default Theory (Hyperintensional Semantics)

### Bimodal Theory

- **Description**: Extends default theory with temporal modal operators.
- **Key Features**:
  - Both counterfactual and temporal modalities
  - Interaction between different modal operators
  - Extended framework for reasoning about time and possibility

## Theory Architecture

Each theory in the library follows a standardized architecture consisting of:

### Core Components

1. **Semantics** (`semantic.py`)

   - Defines the semantic framework and model structure
   - Implements core semantic relations and operations
   - Specifies Z3 constraints that define the theory

2. **Operators** (`operators.py`)

   - Implements logical operators and their semantics
   - Defines primitive operators with verification/falsification conditions
   - Provides derived operators based on primitives

3. **Examples** (`examples.py`)

   - Contains test cases to verify theory behavior
   - Includes both valid theorems and countermodels
   - Provides configuration settings for model checking

4. **API** (`__init__.py`)
   - Exports the theory's public interface
   - Manages dependencies between components
   - Provides a clean entry point for users

### Standard Files

Each theory directory contains:

- `README.md`: Documentation specific to the theory
- `__init__.py`: Public API and dependency management
- `semantic.py`: Core semantic framework implementation
- `operators.py`: Operator definitions and semantics
- `examples.py`: Test cases and examples
- `test/`: Unit tests for the theory (when available)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook demonstrations and examples (when available)

## Using Theories

### Import Strategies

Theory projects support two primary import strategies, each with different use cases:

#### 1. Local Module Imports (for Generated Projects)

When you generate a new theory project with `model-checker -l bimodal`, the examples.py file uses local imports:

```python
# Standard imports
import sys
import os

# Add current directory to path before importing modules
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
if current_dir not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, current_dir)

# Direct imports from local modules
from semantic import BimodalStructure, BimodalSemantics, BimodalProposition
from operators import bimodal_operators
```

**Benefits:**

- Simple, direct imports from files in the same directory
- Projects can be run directly with `model-checker examples.py`
- Changes to the local files are immediately reflected
- Ideal for development and experimentation

**When to use:**

- When you want to modify and experiment with a theory
- When creating a standalone project
- When running the examples.py file directly

#### 2. Package Imports (for Comparison)

To compare your modified theory with the original implementation, you can use package imports:

```python
# Import from the core package
from model_checker.theory_lib.bimodal import (
    BimodalStructure,
    BimodalSemantics,
    BimodalProposition
)
from model_checker.theory_lib.bimodal import bimodal_operators

# Or more generally
from model_checker import get_theory
from model_checker.theory_lib import get_examples

# Load the original theory
theory = get_theory("bimodal")
```

**Benefits:**

- Access to the original implementations for comparison
- Consistency with the package's versioned APIs
- Clear separation between your modifications and the original

**When to use:**

- When comparing your modifications to the original
- When extending the original without modifying it
- When using multiple theories together

### Basic Usage Examples

```python
from model_checker import get_theory
from model_checker.theory_lib import get_examples

# Load a theory
theory = get_theory("default")  # or "exclusion", "imposition", "bimodal"

# Get examples from the theory
examples = get_examples("default")

# Create a model from an example
from model_checker import BuildExample
model = BuildExample("example_name", theory)

# Check a formula
result = model.check_formula("\\Box p -> p")
print(result)
```

### Theory Selection and Configuration

```python
from model_checker import BuildExample

# Load with specific settings
settings = {
    "N": 4,               # Number of atomic states
    "contingent": True,   # Require contingent valuations
    "non_empty": True,    # Require non-empty verifiers/falsifiers
    "disjoint": False,    # Allow overlapping verifiers/falsifiers
    "max_time": 5         # Maximum solving time (seconds)
}

# Build example with theory and settings
model = BuildExample("example_name", get_theory("default"), settings=settings)
```

### Comparing Theories

```python
from model_checker import BuildModule

# Create a module to compare theories
module = BuildModule("comparison")

# Add theories to compare
module.add_theory("default")
module.add_theory("exclusion")

# Run tests across theories
module.run_tests(["test1", "test2"])
```

## Extending with New Theories

To create a new theory:

1. Create a directory under `theory_lib/` (e.g., `theory_lib/my_theory/`)
2. Implement the required files:

   - `semantic.py`: Define your semantic framework
   - `operators.py`: Implement your logical operators
   - `examples.py`: Create test cases
   - `__init__.py`: Export your public API
   - `README.md`: Document your theory

3. Implement theory-specific settings in `semantic.py`
4. Register your theory in `theory_lib/__init__.py`

### Theory-Specific Settings

Each theory in the ModelChecker framework defines its own settings based on the **relevance principle** - only include settings that are relevant to your specific semantic theory. There are two types of settings:

#### Default Example Settings

These settings control the behavior of specific examples:

```python
# In your semantic.py file
class MySemantics(SemanticDefaults):
    DEFAULT_EXAMPLE_SETTINGS = {
        # Core settings included by most theories
        'N': 3,                   # Number of atomic states (required)
        'max_time': 1,            # Maximum solver time (required)
        'contingent': False,      # Whether propositions must be contingent

        # Theory-specific settings (include only what's relevant)
        'my_special_setting': False,  # Setting unique to your theory
    }
```

#### Default General Settings

These settings control global behavior and output format:

```python
# In your semantic.py file
class MySemantics(SemanticDefaults):
    DEFAULT_GENERAL_SETTINGS = {
        # Common output settings
        "print_constraints": False,
        "print_z3": False,
        "save_output": False,

        # Theory-specific settings (only if needed)
        "my_display_setting": True,  # Setting unique to your theory
    }
```

#### Settings Guidelines

1. **Only include settings relevant to your theory**

   - Don't implement settings that don't apply to your semantic framework
   - For example, temporal theories include `M` and `align_vertically`, but others don't

2. **Common settings across theories**

   - `N`: Number of atomic states (required by all theories)
   - `max_time`: Maximum solver time (required by all theories)
   - `contingent`: Whether propositions must be contingent (common but optional)
   - `disjoint`: Whether propositions must have disjoint subject matters (common but optional)

3. **Theory-specific settings examples**
   - `M`: Number of time points (bimodal theory only)
   - `align_vertically`: Display time flowing vertically (bimodal theory only)
   - `non_empty`: Non-empty verifier/falsifier sets (exclusion theory)
   - `fusion_closure`: Enforce fusion closure (exclusion theory)

For detailed information about the settings system and how theory-specific settings are managed, see the [Settings Documentation](../settings/README.md).
You can also find theory specific settings here:

- [Default Theory Settings](theory_lib/default/README.md#default-theory-settings)
- [Bimodal Theory Settings](theory_lib/bimodal/README.md#bimodal-specific-settings)
- [Exclusion Theory Settings](theory_lib/exclusion/README.md#theory-specific-settings)

### Operator Constraints and Syntax Rules

When implementing operators for your theory, adhere to these important constraints:

1. **Reserved Nullary Operators**:

   - `\\top` and `\\bot` are designated nullary operators that cannot be reused as operator names
   - These represent logical truth and falsehood respectively and have special parsing treatment

2. **Well-Formed Formula Rules**:

   - Binary operators must have outer parentheses in well-formed sentences: `(A \\wedge B)`
   - Unary operators do not use parentheses for their main connective: `\\neg A`
   - Nested expressions follow standard parenthesization rules: `\\neg (A \\wedge B)`

3. **LaTeX Notation**:

   - All special symbols should use LaTeX notation: `\\wedge`, `\\vee`, `\\neg`, etc.
   - Operators are designated with a double backslash as in `\\Box` and `\\Future`
   - Custom operators should follow this pattern: `\\myoperator`

4. **Sentence Letters**:

   - Sentence letters are alpha-numeric strings: `A`, `B_2`, `Mary_sings`, etc.
   - Use underscore `_` for spaces in sentence letters (e.g., `Mary_sings`)
   - Sentence letters must not start with a backslash (reserved for operators)

5. **Parsing Considerations**:
   - The parser treats sentences as space-separated tokens
   - Ensure proper spacing in complex formulas: `(A \\wedge (B \\vee C))`
   - Avoid operator names that could conflict with reserved operators

Following these constraints ensures proper parsing and evaluation of logical formulas within the model checker framework.

### Minimal Theory Template

```python
# semantic.py
from model_checker.model import SemanticDefaults, PropositionDefaults, ModelDefaults

class MySemantics(SemanticDefaults):
    """Core semantics for my theory."""

    # Define theory-specific default settings
    DEFAULT_EXAMPLE_SETTINGS = {
        'N': 3,                   # Number of atomic states (required)
        'max_time': 1,            # Maximum solver time (required)
        'contingent': False,      # Common optional setting
        # Add only settings relevant to your theory
    }

    DEFAULT_GENERAL_SETTINGS = {
        "print_constraints": False,
        "print_z3": False,
        "save_output": False,
        # Add only settings relevant to your theory
    }

    # Implement semantic primitives and relations

class MyProposition(PropositionDefaults):
    """Proposition implementation for my theory."""
    # Implement proposition evaluation

class MyModelStructure(ModelDefaults):
    """Model structure for my theory."""
    # Implement model construction and evaluation

# operators.py
from model_checker.syntactic import Operator, DefinedOperator

class MyOperator(Operator):
    """A primitive operator in my theory."""
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("my_op", "\\myop", 1)  # name, symbol, arity

    # Implement semantic methods

my_operators = {
    "\\myop": MyOperator(),
    # Add more operators
}

# __init__.py
from .semantic import MySemantics, MyProposition, MyModelStructure
from .operators import my_operators

__all__ = [
    "MySemantics", "MyProposition", "MyModelStructure",
    "my_operators"
]
```

## Advanced Features

### Theory Translation

Theories can provide translation dictionaries to map operators between theories:

```python
# Translation from Theory A to Theory B
translation_dict = {
    "\\opA": "\\opB",
    "\\another_opA": "\\another_opB"
}

# Use in theory definition
theory_a = {
    "semantics": SemanticA,
    "proposition": PropositionA,
    "operators": operators_a,
    "dictionary": translation_dict  # Used when translating to theory B
}
```

### Custom Model Constraints

Theories can define custom constraints on models:

```python
class CustomSemantics(SemanticDefaults):
    def get_constraints(self):
        """Add custom constraints to the model."""
        constraints = super().get_constraints()

        # Add theory-specific constraints
        my_constraint = self.z3.ForAll([self.s1, self.s2],
                          self.z3.Implies(self.custom_relation(self.s1, self.s2),
                                      self.some_condition(self.s1, self.s2)))
        constraints.append(my_constraint)

        return constraints
```

### Jupyter Notebook Integration

Each theory can include Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration, documentation, and demonstration. These notebooks serve several important purposes:

1. **Theory Documentation**: Explain your theory's semantics with interactive examples
2. **Feature Demonstrations**: Show your theory's operators and key principles in action
3. **Research Exploration**: Provide tools for researchers to experiment with the theory
4. **Teaching Resources**: Create educational materials for students and newcomers
5. **Countermodel Demonstrations**: Show specific examples of interesting countermodels

Notebooks should be placed in a `notebooks/` directory within your theory package, for example:

```
theory_lib/
└── my_theory/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── semantic.py
    ├── operators.py
    ├── examples.py
    └── notebooks/
        ├── introduction.ipynb   # Basic introduction to the theory
        ├── operators.ipynb      # Examples of operator behavior
        └── countermodels.ipynb  # Interesting countermodel examples
```

#### Theory-Specific Visualizations

Theories can provide custom visualization methods for Jupyter notebook integration:

```python
class CustomModelStructure(ModelDefaults):
    def visualize(self):
        """Custom visualization for this theory."""
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        # Implement theory-specific visualization
        return plt.gcf()
```

These visualization methods will be automatically used by the Jupyter integration when displaying models.

For comprehensive information about Jupyter notebook integration, including implementation details, APIs, and usage examples, see the [Jupyter Integration Documentation](../jupyter/README.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions
2. **Documentation**: Include thorough docstrings and README files
3. **Examples**: Provide comprehensive test cases
4. **Unit Tests**: Include tests to verify theory correctness
5. **Modular Design**: Keep semantic components separate from operators
6. **Code Reuse**: Inherit from base classes when possible
7. **Error Handling**: Validate inputs and provide helpful error messages
8. **Performance**: Consider constraint complexity and solving time
