FizzBuzz is a classic programming interview question, often used to test basic coding skills and understanding of loops and conditional statements. The task is as follows:

1.  **Iteration:** Write a program that iterates (loops) through a range of numbers (typically 1 to 100, but the range can be specified).

2.  **Conditional Checks:** For each number in the range, apply these rules:
        *   If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
        *   If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
        *   If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
        *   If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number itself.

3.  **Output:** The output should be a sequence of "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", and numbers, printed one per line (or in a continuous sequence, depending on the specific instructions).
