* **Colormaps:** The `cmap` parameter in `plot_mandelbrot` allows you to easily change the color scheme.  Matplotlib has many built-in colormaps (`'magma'`, `'viridis'`, `'hot'`, `'plasma'`, `'inferno'`, etc.). Experiment with different colormaps to find one you like.
* **Zooming:** The code includes an example of zooming into a specific region of the Mandelbrot set (Seahorse Valley).  To zoom, you simply change the `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min`, and `y_max` values to focus on a smaller area.  You'll also typically need to increase `max_iter` when zooming to get finer details. A very deep zoom is included.
* **Main Block (`if __name__ == '__main__':`)**: The code that *uses* the functions is placed inside an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.  This is good practice.  It ensures that the plotting code only runs when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).
