# This module is now significantly smaller.
# It might only contain the environment submodule placeholder if needed,
# or be empty if environment is fully represented by game_interface.
# Let's keep it minimal for now.

# No submodules left to export directly from here in the new structure.
# The main __init__.py exports the GameState interface.

__all__: list[str] = []  # No public exports from this level anymore
