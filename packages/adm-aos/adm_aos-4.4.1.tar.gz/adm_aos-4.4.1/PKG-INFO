# What is it?

The App Server is a FastAPI/MongoDB program which stores apps for use in Administer and a website later on, there is no backend panel or anything. What you see is what you get.

## Installation Prerequisites

Install python3 3.13 and pip.

In addition to that, make sure you have a MongoDB instance which **runs locally ONLY** without a password. Because it will not have a password, exposing it to the internet is a bad idea.

# Installation

## Standard installation (recommended)

Just clone the repo and run the installer:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/administer-org/app-server

cd app-server

chmod +x Install_AOS.sh
./Install-AOS.sh
```

AOS and a systemd unit will be installed automatically.

## Development installation

Run the following (assuming you already have python3 and pip):
```sh
pip install uv

uv venv

# Enter the venv.. it varies from OS to OS so if this doesn't work just run the command it tells you to
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install .
```

And you're done! Make sure to edit your `__aos__.json` and `config.json` files, then run `aos`.
