# TDengine Query MCP Server

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides **read-only** TDengine database queries for AI assistants. Execute queries, explore database structures, and investigate your data directly from your AI-powered tools.

## Supported AI Tools

This MCP server works with any tool that supports the Model Context Protocol, including:

- **Cursor IDE**: Set up in `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Anthropic Claude**: Use with a compatible MCP client
- **Other MCP-compatible AI assistants**: Follow the tool's MCP configuration instructions

## Features & Limitations

### What It Does

- ✅ Execute **read-only** TDengine queries (SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE only)
- ✅ Work with predefined environments (local, development, staging, production)
- ✅ Provide database information and metadata
- ✅ List available database environments

### What It Doesn't Do

- ❌ Execute write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, etc.)
- ❌ Provide database design or schema generation capabilities
- ❌ Function as a full database management tool

This tool is designed specifically for **data investigation and exploration** through read-only queries. It is not intended for database administration, schema management, or data modification.


## Quick Install

```bash
# Install globally with npm
npm install -g TDengine-query-mcp-server

# Or run directly with npx
uvx TDengine-query-mcp-server
```

## Setup Instructions

### Configure Your AI Tool to Use the MCP Server

Create or edit your MCP configuration file (e.g., `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor IDE):

**Basic Configuration:**
```json
{
  "TDengine": {
    "name": "TDengine Query MCP",
    "description": "TDengine read-only query access through MCP",
    "type": "bin", 
    "enabled": true,
    "bin": "TDengine-query-mcp"
  }
}
```

**Comprehensive Configuration with Database Credentials:**
```json
{
  "TDengine": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["TDengine-query-mcp-server@latest"],
    "env": {
      "LOCAL_DB_HOST": "localhost",
      "LOCAL_DB_USER": "root",
      "LOCAL_DB_PASS": "<YOUR_LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD>",
      "LOCAL_DB_NAME": "your_database",
      "LOCAL_DB_PORT": "3306",
      
      "DEVELOPMENT_DB_HOST": "dev.example.com",
      "DEVELOPMENT_DB_USER": "<DEV_USER>",
      "DEVELOPMENT_DB_PASS": "<DEV_PASSWORD>",
      "DEVELOPMENT_DB_NAME": "your_database",
      "DEVELOPMENT_DB_PORT": "3306",
      
      "STAGING_DB_HOST": "staging.example.com",
      "STAGING_DB_USER": "<STAGING_USER>",
      "STAGING_DB_PASS": "<STAGING_PASSWORD>",
      "STAGING_DB_NAME": "your_database",
      "STAGING_DB_PORT": "3306",
      
      "PRODUCTION_DB_HOST": "prod.example.com",
      "PRODUCTION_DB_USER": "<PRODUCTION_USER>",
      "PRODUCTION_DB_PASS": "<PRODUCTION_PASSWORD>",
      "PRODUCTION_DB_NAME": "your_database",
      "PRODUCTION_DB_PORT": "3306",
      
      "DEBUG": "false",
      "MCP_TDengine_SSL": "true",
      "MCP_TDengine_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "false"
    }
  }
}
```

### Choosing the Right Configuration Approach

There are two ways to configure the TDengine MCP server:

1. **Binary Configuration** (`type: "bin"`, `bin: "TDengine-query-mcp"`)
   - **When to use**: When you've installed the package globally (`npm install -g TDengine-query-mcp-server`)
   - **Pros**: Simpler configuration
   - **Cons**: Requires global installation

2. **Command Configuration** (`command: "npx"`, `args: ["TDengine-query-mcp-server@latest"]`)
   - **When to use**: When you want to use the latest version without installing it globally
   - **Pros**: No global installation required, all configuration in one file
   - **Cons**: More complex configuration

Choose the approach that best fits your workflow. Both methods will work correctly with any AI assistant that supports MCP.

### Important Configuration Notes

- You must use the full environment names: LOCAL_, DEVELOPMENT_, STAGING_, PRODUCTION_
- Abbreviations like DEV_ or PROD_ will not work
- Global settings like DEBUG, MCP_TDengine_SSL apply to all environments
- At least one environment (typically "local") must be configured
- You only need to configure the environments you plan to use
- For security reasons, consider using environment variables or secure credential storage for production credentials

## Configuration Options

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| DEBUG | Enable debug logging | false |
| [ENV]_DB_HOST | Database host for environment | - |
| [ENV]_DB_USER | Database username | - |
| [ENV]_DB_PASS | Database password | - |
| [ENV]_DB_NAME | Database name | - |
| [ENV]_DB_PORT | Database port | 3306 |
| [ENV]_DB_SSL | Enable SSL connection | false |
| MCP_TDengine_SSL | Enable SSL for all connections | false |
| MCP_TDengine_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED | Verify SSL certificates | true |

## Integration with AI Assistants

Your AI assistant can interact with TDengine databases through the MCP server. Here are some examples:

Example queries:

```
Can you use the query tool to show me the first 10 users from the database? Use the local environment.
```

```
I need to analyze our sales data. Can you run a SQL query to get the total sales per region for last month from the development database?
```

```
Can you use the info tool to check what tables are available in the staging database?
```

```
Can you list all the available database environments we have configured?
```

### Using TDengine MCP Tools

The TDengine Query MCP server provides three main tools that your AI assistant can use:

#### 1. query

Execute read-only SQL queries against a specific environment:

```
Use the query tool to run:
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE signup_date > '2023-01-01' LIMIT 10;
on the development environment
```

#### 2. info

Get detailed information about your database:

```
Use the info tool to check the status of our production database.
```

#### 3. environments

List all configured environments from your configuration:

```
Use the environments tool to show me which database environments are available.
```

## Available Tools

The TDengine Query MCP server provides three main tools:

### 1. query

Execute read-only SQL queries:

```sql
-- Example query to run with the query tool
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
```

**Supported query types (strictly limited to)**:
- SELECT statements 
- SHOW commands
- DESCRIBE/DESC tables

### 2. info

Get detailed information about your database:

- Server version
- Connection status
- Database variables
- Process list
- Available databases

### 3. environments

List all configured environments from your configuration:

```
Use the environments tool to show me which database environments are available.
```

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Only read-only queries are allowed (SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE)
- ✅ Each environment has its own isolated connection pool
- ✅ SSL connections are supported for production environments
- ✅ Query timeouts prevent runaway operations
- ⚠️ Consider using secure credential management for database credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. Verify your database credentials in your MCP configuration
2. Ensure the TDengine server is running and accessible
3. Check for firewall rules blocking connections
4. Enable debug mode by setting DEBUG=true in your configuration

### Common Errors

**Error: No connection pool available for environment**
- Make sure you've defined all required environment variables for that environment
- Check that you're using one of the supported environment names (local, development, staging, production)

**Error: Query execution failed**
- Verify your SQL syntax
- Check that you're only using supported query types (SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE)
- Ensure your query is truly read-only
