# Probatus

## Overview

**Probatus** is a python package that helps validate regression & (multiclass) classification models and the data used to develop them. Main features:

- [probatus.interpret](https://ing-bank.github.io/probatus/api/model_interpret.html) provides shap-based model interpretation tools
- [probatus.sample_similarity](https://ing-bank.github.io/probatus/api/sample_similarity.html) to compare two datasets using resemblance modelling, f.e. `train` with out-of-time `test`.
- [probatus.feature_elimination.ShapRFECV](https://ing-bank.github.io/probatus/api/feature_elimination.html) provides cross-validated Recursive Feature Elimination using shap feature importance.

## Installation

```bash
pip install probatus
```
