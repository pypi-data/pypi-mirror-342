   :alt: Quick Overview of IntelliBricks

**The Python-First Framework for Agentic & LLM-Powered Applications**

Are you ready to build truly **intelligent applications** with the ease and clarity of Python?

**Welcome to IntelliBricks!**

IntelliBricks is more than just another LLM framework. It's a **developer-centric toolkit**, crafted from the ground up to empower you to create sophisticated AI applications with **unprecedented simplicity**.  We believe that building with AI should feel as intuitive and natural as writing Python itself.

IntelliBricks helps you overcome the common challenges of AI development:

* **Complexity Overload**:  Simplify development with a streamlined, Python-first approach, reducing layers of abstraction.
* **Unpredictable LLM Interactions**: Achieve reliable and structured outputs from Language Models using Python's type system.
* **Boilerplate Blues**: Eliminate repetitive setup and focus on building *intelligence*, not infrastructure.

Get Started Now!
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install intellibricks

   # Example Synapse Usage - Get a quick taste!
   from intellibricks.llms import Synapse
   synapse = Synapse.of("openai/api/gpt-3.5-turbo") # Or any free model
   response = synapse.complete("Say hello in a funny way!")
   print(f"IntelliBricks says: {response.text}")

Core Modules: Your Intelligent Toolkit
------------------------------------

IntelliBricks is built around two core modules, each designed to be powerful individually and seamlessly integrated for building truly intelligent applications:

   llms
   agents

üß± `LLMs Module <llms>`: Speak Fluently with AI Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``intellibricks.llms`` module is your gateway to Language Model Models (LLMs).  It provides the tools to interact with various LLMs in a consistent and Pythonic manner.

*   ‚úÖ **Synapses**:  Smart adapters for connecting to different LLM providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI, Groq, and more). Switch models effortlessly!
*   ‚úÖ **Structured Outputs**: Define your data models in pure Python and get perfectly formatted responses from LLMs. Say goodbye to messy string parsing!
*   ‚úÖ **Chain of Thought**:  Leverage structured reasoning with the built-in ``ChainOfThought`` class for enhanced observability and debugging.
*   ‚úÖ **Observability**: Seamless integration with Langfuse for tracing, monitoring, and debugging your LLM interactions.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Example: Basic Synapse Usage

   from intellibricks.llms import Synapse

   synapse = Synapse.of("google/genai/gemini-pro-experimental")
   response = synapse.complete("Tell me a joke.")
   print(response.text)

ü§ñ `Agents Module <agents>`: Craft Autonomous Intelligent Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``intellibricks.agents`` module empowers you to build sophisticated, autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks. Agents orchestrate LLM interactions and leverage tools to achieve specific goals.

*   ‚úÖ **Agent Class**: The central building block for creating intelligent cores. Define tasks, instructions, metadata, and connect to Synapses.
*   ‚úÖ **Tool Calling**: Equip your agents with tools to interact with external systems, access data, and perform real-world actions.
*   ‚úÖ **Effortless API Generation**: Instantly turn your agents into production-ready REST APIs using FastAPI or Litestar with minimal code.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Example: Creating a Simple Agent

   from intellibricks.agents import Agent
   from intellibricks.llms import Synapse

   synapse = Synapse.of("openai/api/gpt-4o")
   agent = Agent(
       task="Joke Teller",
       instructions=["You are a funny joke teller."],
       synapse=synapse,
       metadata={"name": "JokeBot", "description": "Agent that tells jokes."},
   )
   response = agent.run("Tell me a joke about Python.")
   print(response.text)
