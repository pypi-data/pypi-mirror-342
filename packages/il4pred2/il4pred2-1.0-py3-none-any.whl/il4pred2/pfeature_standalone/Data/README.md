      <li>Binary Profile</li>
      <li>Evolutionary information</li>
      <li>Structure</li>
      <li>Pattern</li>
</ul>
We have developed number of forms of Pfeature that include: 
<ul>
      <li>A web server that uses Pfeature functions via web interface from https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/pfeature/ </li>
      <li>Standalone version of Pfeature </li>
      <li>Library of python for Pfeature</li>
      <li>Python scripts for computing features</li>
      </ul>
