                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# CLAP - Cognitive Layer Agents Package

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/CLAP.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/CLAP/)
[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/CLAP.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/CLAP/)
<!-- Add other badges as desired, e.g., build status, coverage -->

**CLAP (Cognitive Layer Agent Package)** is a Python framework providing building blocks for creating sophisticated AI agents based on modern agentic patterns. It enables developers to easily construct agents capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with external tools and systems.

Built with an asynchronous core (`asyncio`), CLAP offers flexibility and performance for complex agentic workflows.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Agent Patterns:**
    *   **ReAct Agent:** Implements the Reason-Act loop with robust thought-prompting and native tool calling.
    *   **Multi-Agent Teams:** Define teams of specialized agents with dependencies, enabling collaborative task execution (sequential or parallel).
    *   **Simple Tool Agent:** A straightforward agent for single-step tool usage.
*   **Advanced Tool Integration:**
    *   **Native LLM Tool Calling:** Leverages modern LLM APIs for reliable tool execution.
    *   **Local Tools:** Easily define and use local Python functions (both synchronous and asynchronous) as tools using the `@tool` decorator.
    *   **Remote Tools (MCP):** Integrates with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers via the included `MCPClientManager`, allowing agents to discover and use tools exposed by external systems (currently supports SSE transport).
    *   **Robust Validation:** Uses `jsonschema` for strict validation of tool arguments provided by the LLM.
*   **Pluggable LLM Backends:**
    *   Uses a **Strategy Pattern** (`LLMServiceInterface`) to abstract LLM interactions.
    *   Includes ready-to-use service implementations for:
        *   **Groq:** (`GroqService`)
        *   **Google Generative AI (Gemini):** (`GoogleOpenAICompatService` via OpenAI compatibility layer)
    *   Easily extensible to support other LLM providers.
*   **Asynchronous Core:** Built entirely on `asyncio` for efficient I/O operations and potential concurrency.
*   **Structured Context Passing:** Enables clear and organized information flow between agents in a team using Python dictionaries.
*   **Built-in Tools:** Includes helpers for web search, web scraping, and email interaction (optional dependencies may apply).

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.

```bash
pip install clap-agents

Depending on the tools or LLM backends you intend to use, you might need additional dependencies listed in the pyproject.toml (e.g., groq, openai, mcp, jsonschema, requests, duckduckgo-search, graphviz). Check the [project.dependencies] and [project.optional-dependencies] sections.


Quick Start: Simple Tool calling Agent with a Local Tool
This example demonstrates creating a Tool calling agent using the Groq backend and a local tool

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from clap import ToolAgent
from clap import duckduckgo_search

load_dotenv()

async def main():
    agent = ToolAgent(tools=duckduckgo_search, model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile")
    user_query = "Search the web for recent news about AI advancements."
    response = await agent.run(user_msg=user_query)
    print(f"Response:\n{response}")

asyncio.run(main())



Quick Start: Simple ReAct Agent with a Local Tool
This example demonstrates creating a ReAct agent using the Groq backend and a local tool.


import asyncio
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from clap import ReactAgent, tool, GroqService

# --- Setup ---
load_dotenv() 
@tool
def get_word_length(word: str) -> int:
    """Calculates the length of a word."""
    print(f"[Local Tool] Calculating length of: {word}")
    return len(word)

async def main():
    groq_service = GroqService() # Your service of choice (either groq or Google)
    agent = ReactAgent(
        llm_service=groq_service,
        model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile", # Or another Groq model
        tools=[get_word_length], # Provide the local tool
        # system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant." # Optional base prompt
    )

    user_query = "How many letters are in the word 'framework'?"
    response = await agent.run(user_msg=user_query)
    
    print(response)
    
asyncio.run(main())


Exploring Further
Multi-Agent Teams: See examples/team_agent.py for setting up sequential or parallel agent workflows.
MCP Integration: Check examples/minimal_react_mcp_test.py and examples/test_tool_agent_mcp.py (ensure the corresponding MCP server like examples/minimal_mcp_server.py is running).
Google GenAI: Modify the Quick Start to use GoogleOpenAICompatService instead of GroqService (ensure GOOGLE_API_KEY is set and openai library is installed).
Built-in Tools: Explore the tools provided in clap.tools (like duckduckgo_search, scrape_url, etc.).
