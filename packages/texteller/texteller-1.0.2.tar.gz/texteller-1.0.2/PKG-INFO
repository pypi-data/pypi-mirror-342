           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

TexTeller is an end-to-end formula recognition model, capable of converting images into corresponding LaTeX formulas.

TexTeller was trained with **80M image-formula pairs** (previous dataset can be obtained [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OleehyO/latex-formulas)), compared to [LaTeX-OCR](https://github.com/lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR) which used a 100K dataset, TexTeller has **stronger generalization abilities** and **higher accuracy**, covering most use cases.

## 📮 Change Log

- [2024-06-06] **TexTeller3.0 released!** The training data has been increased to **80M** (**10x more than** TexTeller2.0 and also improved in data diversity). TexTeller3.0's new features:

  - Support scanned image, handwritten formulas, English(Chinese) mixed formulas.

  - OCR abilities in both Chinese and English for printed images.

- [2024-05-02] Support **paragraph recognition**.

- [2024-04-12] **Formula detection model** released!

- [2024-03-25] TexTeller2.0 released! The training data for TexTeller2.0 has been increased to 7.5M (15x more than TexTeller1.0 and also improved in data quality). The trained TexTeller2.0 demonstrated **superior performance** in the test set, especially in recognizing rare symbols, complex multi-line formulas, and matrices.

  > [Here](./assets/test.pdf) are more test images and a horizontal comparison of various recognition models.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install uv:

   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Install the project's dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv pip install texteller
   ```

3. If your are using CUDA backend, you may need to install `onnxruntime-gpu`:

   ```bash
   uv pip install texteller[onnxruntime-gpu]
   ```

4. Run the following command to start inference:

   ```bash
   texteller inference "/path/to/image.{jpg,png}"
   ```

   > See `texteller inference --help` for more details

## 🌐 Web Demo

Run the following command:

```bash
texteller web
```

Enter `http://localhost:8501` in a browser to view the web demo.

> [!NOTE]
> Paragraph recognition cannot restore the structure of a document, it can only recognize its content.

## 🖥️ Server

We use [ray serve](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) to provide an API server for TexTeller. To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
texteller launch
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | -------- |
| `-ckpt` | The path to the weights file,*default is TexTeller's pretrained weights*. |
| `-tknz` | The path to the tokenizer,*default is TexTeller's tokenizer*. |
| `-p` | The server's service port,*default is 8000*. |
| `--num-replicas` | The number of service replicas to run on the server,*default is 1 replica*. You can use more replicas to achieve greater throughput.|
| `--ncpu-per-replica` | The number of CPU cores used per service replica,*default is 1*.|
| `--ngpu-per-replica` | The number of GPUs used per service replica,*default is 1*. You can set this value between 0 and 1 to run multiple service replicas on one GPU to share the GPU, thereby improving GPU utilization. (Note, if --num_replicas is 2, --ngpu_per_replica is 0.7, then 2 GPUs must be available) |
| `--num-beams` | The number of beams for beam search,*default is 1*. |
| `--use-onnx` | Perform inference using Onnx Runtime, *disabled by default* |

To send requests to the server:

```python
# client_demo.py

import requests

server_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict"

img_path = "/path/to/your/image"
with open(img_path, 'rb') as img:
    files = {'img': img}
    response = requests.post(server_url, files=files)

print(response.text)
```

## 🐍 Python API

We provide several easy-to-use Python APIs for formula OCR scenarios. Please refer to our [documentation](https://oleehyo.github.io/TexTeller/) to learn about the corresponding API interfaces and usage.

## 🔍 Formula Detection

TexTeller's formula detection model is trained on 3,415 images of Chinese materials and 8,272 images from the [IBEM dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/4757865).

<div align="center">
    <img src="./assets/det_rec.png" width=250>
</div>

We provide a formula detection interface in the Python API. Please refer to our [API documentation](https://oleehyo.github.io/TexTeller/) for more details.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training

Please setup your environment before training:

1. Install the dependencies for training:
