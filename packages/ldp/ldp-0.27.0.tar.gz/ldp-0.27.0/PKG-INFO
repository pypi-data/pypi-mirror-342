              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

An framework for constructing language model agents and training on constructive tasks.

This repo models agent-environment interactions using a
[Partially Observable Markov Decision Process][pomdp] (POMDP).
Inspired by POMDP, this repo's name `ldp` stands for Language Decision Processes.

[pomdp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process

## Installation

To install `ldp`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

If you plan to export Graphviz visualizations,
make sure you also install the `graphviz` library into your OS via:

- Linux: `apt install graphviz`
- macOS: `brew install graphviz`

## Agent

An agent is something that interacts with an environment (defined in our other GitHub repo [Future-House/aviary](https://github.com/Future-House/aviary)).

An agent uses tools in response to observations, which are just natural language observations. An agent has two functions:

```py
agent_state = await agent.init_state(tools=tools)
new_action, new_agent_state, value = await agent.get_asv(agent_state, obs)
```

`get_asv(agent_state, obs)` chooses an action (`a`) conditioned on the observation messages,
and returns the next agent state (`s`) and a value estimate (`v`).
The first argument, `agent_state`, is a state specific for the agent.
The state is outside of the agent so agents are functional, enabling batching across environments.
You can make the state `None` if you aren't using it. It could contain things like memory, as a list of previous observations and actions.

The `obs` are not the complete list of all prior observations, but rather the return of `env.step`.
Usually the state should keep track of these.

Value is the agent's state-action value estimate; it can default to 0.
This is used for training with reinforcement learning.

## Computing Actions

You can just emit actions directly if you want:

```py
from aviary.core import ToolCall


def get_asv(agent_state, obs):
    action = ToolCall.from_name("calculator_tool", x="3 * 2")
    return action, agent_state, 0
```

but likely you want to do something more sophisticated.
Here's how our `SimpleAgent` - which just relies on a single LLM call - works (typing omitted):

```py
from ldp.agent import Agent
from ldp.graph import LLMCallOp


class AgentState:
    def __init__(self, messages, tools):
        self.messages = messages
        self.tools = tools


class SimpleAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.llm_call_op = LLMCallOp()

    async def init_state(self, tools):
        return AgentState([], tools)

    async def get_asv(self, agent_state, obs):
        action = await self.llm_call_op(
            config={"name": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.1},
            msgs=agent_state.messages + obs,
            tools=agent_state.tools,
        )
        new_state = AgentState(
            messages=agent_state.messages + obs + [action], tools=agent_state.tools
        )
        return action, new_state, 0.0
```

Notice how it's pretty simple. We have to do some bookkeeping - namely appending messages as they come and passing tools. There is no magic here.

### Compute Graph

We do have a compute graph - which helps if you want to differentiate with respect to parameters inside your agent (including possibly the LLM). If your compute graph looks like the above example - where all you do is call an LLM directly, then don't worry about this.

If you want to do more complex agents and train them, then read on. Let's start with an example compute graph

```py
from ldp.graph import FxnOp, LLMCallOp, PromptOp, compute_graph

op_a = FxnOp(lambda x: 2 * x)

async with compute_graph():
    op_result = op_a(3)
```

This creates a compute graph and executes it. The compute graph is silly - just doubles the input. The compute graph executions and gradients are saved in a context for later use, like training updates. For example:

```py
print(op_result.compute_grads())
```

Now, inside the `SimpleAgent` example above, you can see some of the compute graph. Let's see a more complex example for an agent that has a memory it can draw upon.

```py
@compute_graph()
async def get_asv(self, agent_state, obs):
    # Update state with new observations
    next_state = agent_state.get_next_state(obs)

    # Retrieve relevant memories
    query = await self._query_factory_op(next_state.messages)
    memories = await self._memory_op(query, matches=self.num_memories)

    # Format memories and package messages
    formatted_memories = await self._format_memory_op(self.memory_prompt, memories)
    memory_prompt = await self._prompt_op(memories=formatted_memories)
    packaged_messages = await self._package_op(
        next_state.messages, memory_prompt=memory_prompt, use_memories=bool(memories)
    )

    # Make LLM call and update state
    config = await self._config_op()
    result = await self._llm_call_op(
        config, msgs=packaged_messages, tools=next_state.tools
    )
    next_state.messages.extend([result])

    return result, next_state, 0.0
```

You can see in this example that we use differentiable ops to ensure there is a connection in the compute graph from the LLM result (action) back to things like the memory retrieval and the query used to retrieve the memory.

Why use a compute graph? Aside from a gradient, using the compute graph enables the tracking of all inputs/outputs to the ops and serialization/deserialization of the compute graph so that you can easily save/load them. The tracking of input/outputs also makes it easier to do things like fine-tuning or reinforcement learning on the underlying LLMs.

## Generic Support

The `Agent` (as well as classes in `agent.ops`)
are [generics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming),
which means:

- `Agent` is designed to support arbitrary types
- Subclasses can exactly specify state types, making the code more readable

If you are new to Python generics (`typing.Generic`),
please read about them in [Python typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#generics).

Below is how to specify an agent with a custom state type.

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime

from ldp.agents import Agent


@dataclass
class MyComplexState:
    vector: list[float]
    timestamp: datetime = field(default_factory=datetime.now)


class MyAgent(Agent[MyComplexState]):
    """Some agent who is now type checked to match the custom state."""
```

## Complete Example

```py
from ldp.agent import SimpleAgent
from aviary.env import DummyEnv

env = DummyEnv()
agent = SimpleAgent()

obs, tools = await env.reset()
agent_state = await agent.init_state(tools=tools)

done = False
