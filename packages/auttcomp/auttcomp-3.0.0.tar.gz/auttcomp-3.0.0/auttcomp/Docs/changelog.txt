2.0.1
Identity functions are no longer created using Composable directly, instead the .id extension method was added.
Experimental function .select was moved to an experimental branch
License was changed from MIT to GPLv3
Unit tests were cleaned up, focusing more on primitives and less on the complex data samples
Improvements were made to the .shape function, correcting the display of tuples, and added a notation for nullable properties in the format "propertyName?". As this makes it more clear when a dictionary or array property is nullable.
.flatmapid() was removed, instead flatmap() with no parameters should be used. Several functions now support the same defaulting identity function.
Added .zip and .flatnest extensions
