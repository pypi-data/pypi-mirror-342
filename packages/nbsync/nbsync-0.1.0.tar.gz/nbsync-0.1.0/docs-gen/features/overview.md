# Features Overview

nbsync revolutionizes how Jupyter notebooks integrate with MkDocs documentation,
expanding beyond traditional limitations to support multiple file formats and
dynamic execution.

## Key Features

### Multiple File Format Support

nbsync extends support beyond standard `.ipynb` files to include:

- **Markdown Files (.md)** - Create notebooks directly from markdown
- **Python Files (.py)** - Reference Python modules and execute their functions
- **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)** - Traditional notebook support with enhanced
  functionality

### Dynamic Code Execution

Execute code directly within your documentation:

- On-demand execution during documentation builds
- Real-time updates when code changes
- Custom execution environments

### Advanced Display Options

Create rich, interactive documentation:

- Tabbed interface showing both source code and results
- Table-based layouts for comparing visualizations
- Direct function calls within image syntax

### Seamless Integration

Maintain clean, readable documentation:

- Standard markdown syntax with minimal extensions
- No embedded code cells cluttering your documentation
- Clear separation between code and narrative

## Use Cases

### Data Science Documentation

Create comprehensive data analysis reports where visualizations automatically
update when underlying data or code changes.

### API Documentation

Showcase API usage with live examples that execute and display results directly
in the documentation.

### Tutorial Creation

Build interactive tutorials where readers can see both the code and its output
without needing to run notebooks separately.

### Technical Documentation

Maintain technical documentation with automatically updated charts, graphs, and
other visualizations that reflect the current state of your codebase.
