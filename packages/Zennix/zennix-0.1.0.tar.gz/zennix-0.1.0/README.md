Here's a professional README.md for the Zennix library:

**Introduction**
---------------

Zennix is a Python library that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to help developers quickly scaffold new projects. With Zennix, you can generate essential project files, including READMEs, requirements, and test stubs, in a matter of seconds.

**Features**
------------

* **Core Module**: Provides a set of functions to generate project scaffolding files, including READMEs, requirements, and test stubs.
* **CLI Module**: Offers a command-line interface to interact with Zennix, allowing you to quickly generate project scaffolding files.
* **LLM Module**: Utilizes Large Language Models to generate high-quality project scaffolding files, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

**Installation**
--------------

To install Zennix, run the following command:
```bash
pip install zennix
```
**Usage**
---------

To use Zennix, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
zennix init <project_name>
```
Replace `<project_name>` with the desired name for your new project. Zennix will then generate the necessary project files and folders.

**CLI**
-----

The Zennix CLI provides a range of commands to help you manage your projects. Here are a few examples:

* `zennix init <project_name>`: Initializes a new project with the specified name.
* `zennix generate <file_type>`: Generates a specific type of file, such as a README or requirements file.
* `zennix test`: Runs a set of tests to ensure your project is properly configured.
