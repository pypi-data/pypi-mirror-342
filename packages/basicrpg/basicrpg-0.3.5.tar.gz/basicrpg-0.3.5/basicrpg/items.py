#Whoa! Look at you! Your going into the code WITHIN THE CODE!!! NO WAY! Congrats on getting here if you're a noob, I wouldnt have understood what this was like 2 days ago TBH
#If you want to take the extra leap to make your own item type, make sure that has at minimum the following properties:
#self,name,weight,description,is_pickable,item_type

#FUTURE PLAN FOR ALL ITEMS! All items will have a use() function. This will simply be what the item does. Example: food will contain code to heal the character. Character will be able to call the use function of any item.
#On this: ALL INVENTORY CHECKING AND HANDLING WILL BE HANDLED BY THE CHARACTER OBJECT, example: an item use function wil NOT contain code to remove it from a character inventory
