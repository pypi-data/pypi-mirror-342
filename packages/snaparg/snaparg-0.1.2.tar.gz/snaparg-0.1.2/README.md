# snaparg

`snaparg` is a lightweight Python library that wraps around the built-in `argparse` module, making command-line interfaces more user-friendly by detecting typos in argument names and suggesting the closest valid alternatives.

Perfect for scripts and tools that aim to be a little more forgiving to users without sacrificing the power and flexibility of `argparse`.
