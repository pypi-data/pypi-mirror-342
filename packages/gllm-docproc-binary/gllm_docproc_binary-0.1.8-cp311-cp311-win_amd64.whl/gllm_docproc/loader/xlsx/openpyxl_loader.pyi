    split a table into headers and body based on the row styles and header threshold.

    Methods:
        load(self, source: str, loaded_elements: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None, **kwargs: Any)
            -> list[dict[str, Any]]: Load a XLSX document.

        This method loads a XLSX document and extracts the table elements from each sheet.
        The method takes the source file path as input and returns a list of Element objects

        Args:
            source (str): The path to the XLSX document to load.
            loaded_elements (list[dict[str, Any]]): The loaded elements from previous loaders.
            **kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments to pass to the loader.

        Kwargs:
            original_source (str, optional): The original source of the document.

        Returns:
            list[dict[str, Any]]: The loaded elements from the XLSX document.
