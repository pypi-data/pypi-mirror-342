               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Dpsn-client (Python)

## Overview

`dpsn-client` is a Python SDK for interacting with the DPSN infrastructure. It allows you to connect to a DPSN broker using your Ethereum wallet for authentication, publish messages to topics.Explore and subscribe to existing data streams directly from the [DPSN Streams Marketplace](https://streams.dpsn.org).

For more information, visit:
- [DPSN Official Website](https://dpsn.org)


## Installation

```bash
pip install dpsn-client
```
>*Note: If installing from source or locally, navigate to the root directory and run `pip install -e .`*

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- **DPSN URL:** The hostname of the DPSN MQTT broker (e.g., `betanet.dpsn.org`).
- **Wallet Private Key:** Your Ethereum private key (starting with `0x`). This wallet will be used for authentication. Ensure it's kept secure.
- **Chain Options:** Specify the network (`mainnet` or `testnet`) and chain type (`ethereum`).

*(Blockchain interaction features like purchasing topics, fetching owned topics, and getting topic prices are planned for future versions and require additional configuration not yet implemented in this Python client.)*

### Import the Library

```python
from dpsn_client import DpsnClient, DPSNError
```

### Create Client Instance

Initialize the client with your DPSN broker URL, private key, and chain options.

```python
dpsn_url = "your-dpsn-broker.com"  # e.g., betanet.dpsn.org
private_key = "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY" # Replace with your actual private key

client = DpsnClient(
    dpsn_url=dpsn_url,
    private_key=private_key,
    chain_options={
        "network": "testnet",        # or "mainnet"
        "wallet_chain_type": "ethereum"
    },
    # Optional: connection_options={'ssl': True} # Default is True
)
```

### Understanding DPSN Topics

Topics in DPSN are data distribution channels designed for secure, permissioned data streams associated with blockchain wallets.

- **Ownership-based channels**: While topic *purchase* happens on the blockchain (feature planned), the MQTT authentication relies on the owner's wallet.
- **Data streams**: Authenticated publishers push data to topics, and subscribers receive data.
- **Authenticated channels**: The client uses signatures derived from the owner's private key to authenticate actions like connecting and publishing.

- When publishing data, the publishing client uses the same private key that purchased the topic to authenticate the request, ensuring only authorized wallets can publish to their owned topics.


*(Full topic lifecycle management via smart contracts, including purchasing and ownership verification).*

### Setup Blockchain Configuration

To interact with the DPSN contract for topic management, you need to set the blockchain configuration:

```python
# Configure blockchain connectivity
rpc_url = "https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY"  # Replace with your RPC provider
contract_address = "0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"              # Replace with deployed contract address

# Set up the blockchain config
contract = client.set_blockchain_config(
    rpc_url=rpc_url,
    contract_address=contract_address
)
```

### Purchasing a Topic

To publish data to DPSN, you first need to purchase a topic. This operation registers your topic on the blockchain:

```python
try:
    # Purchase a new topic (this is a blockchain transaction that costs ETH)
    topic_name = "BTC/USDT"  # Human-readable name
    result = client.purchase_topic(
        topic_name=topic_name,
        confirmations=2,      # Number of confirmations to wait for
        timeout=120           # Timeout in seconds
    )
    
    # Save the generated topic hash for publishing
    topic_hash = result["topic"]  # Format: 0x...
    print(f"Successfully purchased topic '{topic_name}' with hash: {topic_hash}")
    print(f"Transaction hash: {result['tx_hash']}")
    
except DPSNError as e:
    print(f"Failed to purchase topic: {e}")
```

### Fetching Your Owned Topics

You can retrieve all topics owned by your wallet:

```python
try:
    topics = client.fetch_owned_topics()
    print(f"Your wallet owns {len(topics)} topics:")
    for topic in topics:
        print(f"- {topic['name']}: {topic['topic']} (registered at {topic['registered_at']})")
except DPSNError as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch topics: {e}")
```

### Get Topic Price

Check the current price required to register a topic:

```python
try:
    price_wei = client.get_topic_price()
    price_eth = float(client.web3.from_wei(price_wei, 'ether'))
    print(f"Current topic price: {price_eth} ETH ({price_wei} wei)")
except DPSNError as e:
    print(f"Failed to get topic price: {e}")
```

### Setup Event Handlers

Use decorators to define handlers for asynchronous events like receiving messages or errors. Set these up *before* calling `init()`.

```python
def handle_message(message_data):
    """Handles incoming messages."""
    topic = message_data.get('topic')
    payload = message_data.get('payload')
    logger.info(f"Received message on topic '{topic}': {payload}")

def handle_error(error: DPSNError):
    """Handles errors reported by the client."""
    logger.error(f"DPSN Client Error: {error}")

# You can also add handlers later if needed:
# client.on_msg += another_message_handler
# client.on_error += another_error_handler
```

### Initialize DPSN Client

Connect to the DPSN MQTT broker. This authenticates using a signature generated from your private key.

```python
# Initialize the client connection
try:
    client.init()
    print("Connected to DPSN MQTT broker successfully")
except DPSNError as e:
    print(f"Failed to connect: {e}")
```

### Publish Data

Publish a JSON-serializable message to a specific topic string. The topic must start with your wallet address (`0x...`).

> **Caution:** You must initialize the client with the private key corresponding to the wallet address used in the topic prefix.

```python
# Example topic
publish_topic = "0xe14768a6d8798e4390ec4cb8a4c991202c2115a5cd7a6c0a7ababcaf93b4d2d4/BTCUSDT/ticker"
data_to_publish = {"ticker": "BTC/USDT", "price":83387.13000000, "timestamp": time.time()}

try:
    #Publishing to topic
    client.publish(publish_topic, data_to_publish, options={'qos': 1})
    #Message published successfully
except DPSNError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to publish: {e}")
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Publish error (invalid topic format?): {e}")
```

### Subscribing to Topics

Subscribe to a topic pattern to receive messages.

```python
subscribe_topic = "0xe14768a6d8798e4390ec4cb8a4c991202c2115a5cd7a6c0a7ababcaf93b4d2d4/BTCUSDT/ticker" # Subscribe to topic 

try:
    #Subscribing to topic
    client.subscribe(subscribe_topic, options={'qos': 1})
    #Successfully subscribed to the topic

    # Keep the script running to receive messages
    logger.info("Waiting for messages... Press Ctrl+C to exit.")
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)

except DPSNError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to subscribe: {e}")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    logger.info("Interrupted by user.")

```

### Unsubscribing from Topics

Stop receiving messages from a specific topic.

```python
# Unsubscribe ongoing topic subscription
try:
    client.unsubscribe(subscribe_topic)
except DPSNError as e:
    print(f"Failed to unsubscribe: {e}")
```

### Disconnect

Disconnect cleanly from the MQTT broker.

```python
# Disconnect client connection
try:
    client.disconnect()
except DPSNError as e:
    print(f"Error during disconnect: {e}")
```

## API Reference

### Class `DpsnClient`

Manages the connection, authentication, and messaging with the DPSN  client. Inherits from `events.Events`.

#### Constructor

```python
DpsnClient(
    dpsn_url: str,
    private_key: str,
    chain_options: Dict[str, Any],
    connection_options: Dict[str, Any] = None
)
```
- `dpsn_url`: Hostname of the DPSN broker.
- `private_key`: Ethereum wallet private key (`0x...`).
- `chain_options`: Dictionary, requires `{"network": "mainnet"|"testnet", "wallet_chain_type": "ethereum"}`.
- `connection_options`: Optional dictionary, e.g., `{"ssl": True}` (default).

#### Methods

- `init(options: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> mqtt.Client`: Connects and authenticates to the broker. `options` can include `retry_options`. Raises `DPSNError` on failure.
- `publish(topic: str, message: Any, options: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> None`: Publishes a JSON-serializable `message` to `topic`. `topic` must start with `self.wallet_address`. `options` can include `qos` (default 1) and `retain` (default False). Raises `DPSNError` or `ValueError`.
- `subscribe(topic: str, options: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> None`: Subscribes to `topic`. `options` can include `qos` (default 1). Raises `DPSNError`.
- `unsubscribe(topic: str) -> None`: Unsubscribes from `topic`. Raises `DPSNError`.
- `disconnect() -> None`: Disconnects from the broker. Raises `DPSNError`.
- `generate_topic_hash(topic_name: str) -> str`: Generates a unique hash for a given `topic_name` using a nonce and keccak256. *(Note: This is currently a utility function and not directly used for publish/subscribe which rely on the wallet address prefix).*
