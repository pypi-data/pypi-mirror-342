# Overview

`KingLoki` provides a location based encryption protocol which makes sure any encrypted content can only be decrypted at the location where it was encrypted.

Documentation as of now is not available. However, each module contains docstrings wherever applicable. Some modules are exempt from docstring due to security reasons, however, the underlying methods would be visible.

For safe usage, only use `Loki` class under `KingLoki.protocols` module.
