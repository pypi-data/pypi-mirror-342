    """The `Loki Protocol` for encryption!
    
    Inspired by the norse god of mischief and ofcource the god of stories (at
    later stages), this encryption protocol uses geocode for encryption making
    sure, decryption is only possible at a specific location. If security is
    what you care for most, this protocol is your ideal choice among others.

    The `Loki Protocol` encrypts in 5 undisclosed stages based on your system's
    geocode, which will be collected with your consent through the default
    system browser.

    Decryption failure at any particular stage will result in complete failure.

    Usage:
    ```python
    # initial setup
    Loki.setupPreRequisitesForProtocol_(wcount=10) # default worker count is 5.

    # encryption/decryption
    assert [1, 2, 3] == Loki.decryptionProtocolFromContentToContent_(
                    Loki.encryptionProtocolFromContentToContent_(
                    [1, 2, 3]))

    # end
    Loki.finalize()
    ```

    While using this with the `with` keyword, to increase the worker count, use:

    ```python
    Loki.set_worker_count(workers=10) # before using the with statement

    with Loki as loki:
        loki.encryptionProtocolFromContentToFile_(...)

    ```
