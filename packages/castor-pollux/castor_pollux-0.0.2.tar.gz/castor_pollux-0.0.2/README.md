# castor-pollux
Castor-Pollux (the twin sons of Zeus, routinely called 'gemini') is a pure REST API library for interacting with Google Generative AI API.

## Without (!!!):
- any whiff of 'Vertex' or GCP;
- any signs of 'Pydantic' or unnecessary (and mostly useless) typing;
- any other dependencies of other google packages trashed into the dumpster `google-genai` package.

## Installation:
<pre>
  pip install castor-pollux
</pre>
Then:
```Python
  # Python
  import castor_pollux.rest as cp
```
