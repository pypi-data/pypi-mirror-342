grogupy: Relativistic magnetic interactions from non-orthogonal basis sets
==========================================================================

grogupy was created to easily extract magnetic interaction parameters from
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Because the underlying theory
focuses on non-orthogonal basis sets, the most straightforward software to
use for the DFT calculation is `Siesta <https://siesta-project.org/siesta/>`_.

It is based on the grogupy matlab implementation and the `sisl
<https://sisl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ package. grogupy was created 
by the `TRILMAX Consortium <https://trilmax.elte.hu>`_.

More on the theoretical background can be seen on `arXiv
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02558>`_.
