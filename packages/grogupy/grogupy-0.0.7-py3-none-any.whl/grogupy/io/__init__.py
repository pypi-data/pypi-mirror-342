Input/Output
=============

.. currentmodule:: grogupy.io


This subpackage contains various routines to read in different input files
and to process the information. The main goal is to convert the information
from the input files to a format that can be used by the ``Builder`` class
from the ``grogupy`` package.

Functions
---------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/

    load                   General loader for any grogupy instance.
    save                   Saves instances in a pickled dictionary.
    save_magnopy           Saves instances in magnopy input format.

Background information
----------------------

These functions were written early in the developement and a lot changed since
then. The functions are not used in the main code and are not tested. They are
here for reference and for future development, but they should be rewritten.

Examples
--------

For examples, see the various functions.
