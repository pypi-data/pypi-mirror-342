# Plasma-AI

**Plasma-AI**, part of the **DE-AI** project developed for artificial intelligence-based Linux desktop environments, is designed to bring AI-powered enhancements to all desktop systems.

## Features

- 📊 Detects and suggests fixes for memory and CPU inefficiencies
- 🧠 Integrates seamlessly with your desktop environment
- ⚙️ Disables unnecessary background services
- 🔋 Recommends power-saving strategies based on system activity
- 🤖 Grants auto-prop automation permissions for intelligent process control

## About

With the current architecture, the **DE-AI artificial intelligence system** can detect and suggest fixes for vulnerabilities in memory usage, identify processes that consume excessive resources or overburden the CPU, and integrate seamlessly with your desktop environment.

It can also provide energy-saving recommendations based on your system’s performance and usage habits. By granting itself auto-prop automation permissions, it intelligently manages background services — disabling unnecessary ones to optimize system performance.

## Part of Linux-AI

**DE-AI** is developed as a core component of the broader **Linux-AI project**.

## The Future of Linux

> In the near future, Linux will evolve into a fully AI-driven operating system — capable of performing automation tasks, optimizing itself, and adapting to your needs without manual intervention.
