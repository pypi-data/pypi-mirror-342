## üåü Why I Made This

I wanted a more efficient way to update my ETS2 mods without having to 

1. manually zip the directory,
2. set the name and compression,
3. rename from ".zip" to ".scs" after creation,
4. delete the old one in my mods directory,
5. copy and paste from my working directory to my mods directory...

EVERY. TIME.

No more nonesense.

There is now an easier way.
