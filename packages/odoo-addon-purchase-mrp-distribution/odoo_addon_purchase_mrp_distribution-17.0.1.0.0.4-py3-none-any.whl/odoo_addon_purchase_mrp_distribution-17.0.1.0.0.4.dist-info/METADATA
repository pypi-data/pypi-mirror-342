This module allows you to buy a product that will be divided into others
without knowing the exact quantity of the others. That quantity will be
filled in the picking.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module aims to address the need to receive a generic product, but
until the moment of reception, we do not know the quantity that we might
receive of its specific products.

Using kits was not suitable for us, because to account for a unit of the
kit product, the quantity specified in the BoM must be received.
Therefore, we opted to define a new type of BoM called distribution.

In this way, upon receiving a unit of any product added to the BoM, it
will be accounted for as a unit of the generic product and will be
reflected in the svls as separate products, but they will be accounted
for in the purchase line as part of the product.

Configuration
=============

To use this module, we will need to configure n different
distribution-type Bills of Materials (BoM) for n products. To do this,
we will follow these steps:

1. Go to Manufacturing > Products > Bills of Materials
2. Click on Create
3. Select the product to be distributed in the receptions
4. Select the BoM type "Distribution"
5. In the components, add the products that can be filled in the
   reception (it is not necessary to mark the quantity as it will
   default to 0)

Usage
=====

To see the module's functionality:

1. Create a new purchase order
2. Add the product for which the BoM has been created
3. Confirm the order
4. Go to the created delivery order
5. You will see a new button in the move that contains the product,
   click on it
6. A wizard will open to define the quantity of each product to
   distribute
7. By clicking on Distribute, the move lines will be added with the
   products from the BoM

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

1. The current module is not designed to handle multi-step receipts. It
   operates on a single-step process, making it unsuitable for more
   complex inventory management scenarios.
2. The current module is not designed to handle multiple lots for a
   product.
3. The current module is not designed to handle multiple packages for a
   product.
