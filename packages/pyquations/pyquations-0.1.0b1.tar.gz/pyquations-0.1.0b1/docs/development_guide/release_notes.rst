Release Notes
=============

When making updates to the `pyquations` project, it is important to update the associated release notes file for the upcoming version in the `docs/release_notes` folder. These files ensure that users are informed about the changes, new features, and bug fixes included in each release. This differs from the GitHub release notes, which are automatically generated from the pull request titles and descriptions. This document provides more detailed information for users and is included on the documentation site.

What to Include
===============

Release notes should provide clear and concise messaging that is relevant to users. Focus on the following:

- **New Features**: Highlight any new functionality or additions to the project.
- **Changes**: Document any significant updates or improvements to existing features.
- **Bug Fixes**: List any resolved issues or bugs that users might have encountered.

Avoid including internal details or changes that are not directly relevant to users. The goal is to provide information that helps users understand what's new or improved in the release.
