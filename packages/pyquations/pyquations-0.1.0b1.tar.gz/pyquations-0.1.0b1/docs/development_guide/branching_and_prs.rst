Branching and Pull Requests
===========================

Branching
=========

All changes to the `pyquations` project must be made on a branch created from the `main` branch. This ensures that the `main` branch remains stable and ready for releases. There are no complex branching requirementsâ€”simply create a branch for your changes, make your updates, and submit a pull request to merge them into `main` when ready.

Pull Requests
=============

When submitting changes, contributors are advised to use draft pull requests to indicate work in progress. Once the changes are complete, follow these steps to ensure your pull request meets the project's standards prior to marking it as ready for review:

- Ensure that the pull request template is filled out and all checklist items are completed.
- Verify that all builds pass successfully, including testing, linting, and documentation builds.
- Include a descriptive title of the changes made for the pull request. This gets populated into the GitHub release notes.

After the PR is approved and merged into `main`, the changes will automatically be included in the next release.
