def newtons_second_law(
    *,
    mass: float,
    acceleration: float,
    force: float,
) -> float:
    """Solve for one variable in Newton's second law of motion given the other
    two.

    The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the
    amount of force applied. [1]_

    .. math::

        F = m \\cdot a

    Where:

    - :math:`F` is the force in newtons (N).
    - :math:`m` is the mass in kilograms (kg).
    - :math:`a` is the acceleration in meters per second squared (m/sÂ²).

    Newton's second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for
    which all existing forces are not balanced. The second law states that the
    acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force
    acting upon the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of an
    object depends directly upon the net force acting upon the object, and
    inversely upon the mass of the object. As the force acting upon an object
    is increased, the acceleration of the object is increased. As the mass of
    an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is decreased. [2]_

    .. note::
        Provide 2 of the 3 parameters. The method will solve for the third.

    Args:
        mass (float): The mass of the object in kilograms. Must be
            non-negative.
        acceleration (float): The acceleration of the object in meters per
            second squared.
        force (float): The force exerted on the object in newtons. Must be
            non-negative.

    Returns:
        float: The force exerted on the object in newtons (N).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If there aren't exactly 2 parameters provided.
        ValueError: If mass is provided and is not greater than zero.
        ValueError: If acceleration is provided and is not greater than zero.
        ValueError: If force is provided and is negative.

    Examples:
        Solve for Force

        >>> newtons_second_law(mass=10, acceleration=2)
        20.0

        Solve for Mass

        >>> newtons_second_law(force=20, acceleration=2)
        10.0

        Solve for Acceleration

        >>> newtons_second_law(force=20, mass=10)
        2.0
