# Acknowledgments
Two Sonardyne Fetch AZA instruments were deployed at the western boundary of the [RAPID 26Â°N array](http://rapid.ac.uk) in 2023, as a collaboration between the University of Hamburg in the [EPOC](http://epoc-eu.org) project, geophysicists [Kate Rychert](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/catherine.rychert/) and [Nick Harmon](https://directory.whoi.edu/profile/nicholas-harmon/) at WHOI, [Shane Elipot](https://selipot.github.io) at University of Miami and the RAPID array with the [RAPID evolution project](https://noc.ac.uk/projects/rapid-evolution).

This software was initiated as part of Work Package 5, EPOC - which includes the task to evaluate whether drift-free bottom pressure sensors could be used to improve observational methods for the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC).  It is available free of charge and without guarantee.  See the license statement in the repository: https://github.com/eleanorfrajka/fetchAZA/blob/main/LICENSE for further details.
