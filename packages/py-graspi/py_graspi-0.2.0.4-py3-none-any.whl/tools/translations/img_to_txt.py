        Converts an image file into a .txt file, dimensions are multiplied by resizeFactor.

        Args:
            imageFile (string): path of the image file.
            resizeFactor (float): resizeFactor used to multiply X and Y dimensions of imageFile to either truncate or enlarge.
            threshold (float): threshold used for deciding color intensity of what is considered white or black in numpy array of image

        Returns:
            bool_array (numpy Array): numpy array of boolean array which signal if index should be black or white.
