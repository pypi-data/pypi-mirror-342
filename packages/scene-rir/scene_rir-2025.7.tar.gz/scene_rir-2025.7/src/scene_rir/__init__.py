"""
    Room Impulse Response extraction package.

    The purpose of this package is to extract the room impulse response (RIR) from the
    recorded response signal of a proper excitation signal. It is part of the Audio
    Simulation Module of the Horizon project SCENE.

    Modules:
    - rir: Provides the classes implementing swept-sine excitation signal creation and
        room impulse response extraction from a recorded response.

    Examples:
    Example of usage from command line (Windows OS):
    > python -m scene_rir.rir
    Usage: python -m scene_rir.rir [command] [parameter1] [parameter2]
    or
    python3 -m scene_rir.rir [command] [parameter1] [parameter2]
    Available commands:
    save   Save the default swept-sine signal.

    > python -m scene_rir.rir --help
    Usage: python -m scene_rir.rir [command] [parameter1] [parameter2]
    or
    python3 -m scene_rir.rir [command] [parameter1] [parameter2]
    Available commands:
    save   Save the default swept-sine signal.

    > python -m scene_rir.rir save my_folder/my_signal.wav
