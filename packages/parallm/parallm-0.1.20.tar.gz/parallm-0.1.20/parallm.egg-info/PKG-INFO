           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by each Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise comply with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# ParaLLM

ParaLLM is a command-line tool and Python package for efficiently querying language models. It supports batch processing with multiple prompts and models, and now includes structured JSON output via schemas.

## Features

- **Multi-Model Querying:** Query multiple LLMs simultaneously, comparing their outputs
- **CSV Input/Output:** Use CSV files for batch processing of prompts
- **Structured JSON Output:** Get responses formatted to JSON schemas or Pydantic models
- **Single-Query Mode:** Use `parallm single` for quick one-off queries with schema support
- **High Performance:** Leverages Bodo for parallel execution of queries
- **AWS Bedrock Support:** Query AWS Bedrock models with the same interface
- **Google Gemini Support:** Query Google Gemini models with native schema support

## Installation

```bash
pip install parallm
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strangeloopcanon/parallm.git
cd parallm
pip install -e .
```

You'll need to install Simon Willison's `llm` package and set up your API keys. For AWS Bedrock, ensure you have AWS credentials configured. For Gemini, set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Command-Line Usage

### Regular LLM Queries

```bash
# Process prompts.csv with two different models
parallm --prompts data/prompts.csv --models gpt-4o-mini claude-3-sonnet-20240229

# Using a JSON schema for structured output
parallm --prompts data/prompts.csv --models gpt-4o-mini --schema '{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "answer": {"type": "string"},
    "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1}
  },
  "required": ["answer", "confidence"]
}'

# Using a schema from file
parallm --prompts data/prompts.csv --models gpt-4o-mini --schema schema.json

# Using a Pydantic model
parallm --prompts data/prompts.csv --models gpt-4o-mini --pydantic models.py:ResponseModel
```

### Single Query Mode

```bash
# Basic query
parallm single "What is the capital of France?"

# Specify a different model
parallm single "What is the capital of France?" --model claude-3-opus-20240229

# Repeat the same query multiple times
parallm single "What is the capital of France?" --repeat 100

# Get structured JSON response using inline schema
parallm single "Describe a nice dog" --schema '{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "age": {"type": "integer"},
    "breed": {"type": "string"},
    "personality_traits": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
  },
  "required": ["name", "age", "breed", "personality_traits"]
}'
```

### AWS Bedrock Queries

```bash
# Single query with AWS Bedrock
parallm aws single "What is the capital of France?" --model anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229

# Repeat a query multiple times with AWS Bedrock
parallm aws single "What is the capital of France?" --model anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229 --repeat 100

# Batch process with AWS Bedrock models
parallm aws batch --prompts data/prompts.csv --models anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229 amazon.titan-text-express-v1
```

### Google Gemini Queries

```bash
# Single query with Gemini
parallm gemini "What is the capital of France?" --model gemini-2.0-flash

# Repeat a query multiple times with Gemini
parallm gemini "What is the capital of France?" --model gemini-2.0-flash --repeat 100

# Batch process with Gemini
parallm gemini --prompts data/prompts.csv --models gemini-2.0-flash

# Using a Pydantic model for structured output
parallm gemini "List a few popular cookie recipes" --pydantic models.py:Recipe

# Using a JSON schema for structured output
parallm gemini "Describe a nice dog" --schema '{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "age": {"type": "integer"},
    "breed": {"type": "string"},
    "personality_traits": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
  },
  "required": ["name", "age", "breed", "personality_traits"]
}'
```

### Batch Repeating Queries (CSV, Multiple Models)

#### Command-Line Usage

```bash
# Default (OpenAI/llm): Repeat each (prompt, model) pair 10 times
parallm --prompts data/prompts.csv --models gpt-4o-mini claude-3-sonnet-20240229 --repeat 10

# AWS Bedrock: Repeat each (prompt, model) pair 5 times
parallm aws batch --prompts data/prompts.csv --models anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229 --repeat 5

# Gemini: Repeat each (prompt, model) pair 7 times
parallm gemini --prompts data/prompts.csv --models gemini-2.0-flash --repeat 7
```

## Python API Usage

### Basic Queries

```python
from parallm import query_model

# Simple text query
response = query_model("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)  # Paris

# Different model
response = query_model("What is the capital of France?", model_given="claude-3-sonnet-20240229")
print(response)
```

### AWS Bedrock Queries

```python
from parallm import bedrock_query_model

# Simple text query with AWS Bedrock
response = bedrock_query_model("What is the capital of France?", model_id="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229")
print(response)

# Batch processing with AWS Bedrock
from parallm import bedrock_query_model_all
import pandas as pd

df = bedrock_query_model_all("data/prompts.csv", ["anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229", "amazon.titan-text-express-v1"])
print(df)
```

### Google Gemini Queries

```python
from parallm import gemini_query
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Simple text query
response = gemini_query.query_model("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)

# Using a Pydantic model
class Recipe(BaseModel):
    recipe_name: str
    ingredients: list[str]

# Get parsed Pydantic model directly
recipes = gemini_query.query_model(
    prompt="List a few popular cookie recipes. Be sure to include the amounts of ingredients.",
    model_id="gemini-2.0-flash",
    schema=Recipe
)
print(recipes.recipe_name)
print(recipes.ingredients)

# Using JSON schema
json_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "recipe_name": {"type": "string"},
        "ingredients": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
    }
}

# Get JSON string
json_response = gemini_query.query_model(
    prompt="List a few popular cookie recipes. Be sure to include the amounts of ingredients.",
    model_id="gemini-2.0-flash",
    schema=json_schema
)

# Batch processing
df = gemini_query.query_model_all(
    file_path="data/prompts.csv",
    models=["gemini-2.0-flash"]
)
print(df)
```

### Structured JSON Output

```python
from parallm import query_model_json

# Using JSON schema
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "answer": {"type": "string"},
        "confidence": {"type": "number"}
    },
    "required": ["answer", "confidence"]
}

result = query_model_json("Describe a nice dog", schema=schema)
print(result)
# Output: {'name': 'Buddy', 'age': 3, 'is_friendly': True}
```

### Using Pydantic Models

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List
from parallm import query_model_json

class Dog(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    breed: str
    personality_traits: List[str]

# Get response structured according to the Pydantic model
dog = query_model_json("Describe a nice dog", schema=Dog)

print(f"Name: {dog['name']}")
print(f"Age: {dog['age']}")
print(f"Breed: {dog['breed']}")
print("Personality traits:")
for trait in dog['personality_traits']:
    print(f"- {trait}")
```

### Batch Processing

```python
from parallm import query_model_all
import pandas as pd

# Process multiple prompts with multiple models
df = query_model_all("data/prompts.csv", ["gpt-4o-mini", "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"])
print(df)

# With JSON schema
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "answer": {"type": "string"},
        "confidence": {"type": "number"}
    },
    "required": ["answer", "confidence"]
}

df = query_model_all("data/prompts.csv", ["gpt-4o-mini"], schema=schema)

# Process the results
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    result = json.loads(row['response'])
    print(f"Prompt: {row['prompt']}")
    print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
    print("---")

# Save results
df.to_csv("structured_results.csv", index=False)
```

### Repeating a Query N Times (Easy Top-Level Import)

```python
from parallm import query_model_repeat, bedrock_query_model_repeat, gemini_query_model_repeat

# Default (OpenAI/llm)
df = query_model_repeat("What is the capital of France?", repeat=10)
print(df)

# AWS Bedrock
df = bedrock_query_model_repeat("What is the capital of France?", model_id="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229", repeat=5)
print(df)

# Gemini
df = gemini_query_model_repeat("What is the capital of France?", model_id="gemini-2.0-flash", repeat=7)
print(df)
```

### Batch Repeating Queries (CSV, Multiple Models)

#### Python API Usage

```python
from parallm import query_model_all_repeat, bedrock_query_model_all_repeat, gemini_query_model_all_repeat
