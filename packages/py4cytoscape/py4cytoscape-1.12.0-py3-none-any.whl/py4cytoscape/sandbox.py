"""Functions for performing file operations within a sandbox.

A sandbox is a directory on the Cytoscape workstation that is guaranteed writeable and is guaranteed to be isolated
from the whole file system. All Python and Cytoscape file operations are carried out relative to the "current sandbox".
Sandboxes primarily address file access issues when running workflows on a remote server (and accessing Cytoscape
running on the workstation, either via direct HTTP or via Jupyter-Bridge).

When running a workflow on the Cytoscape workstation (i.e., locally, not remotely), the entire workstation's file
system would be directly accessible to the workflow, and sandboxing isn't an issue. Essentially, this
acknowledges that the user has rightful and safe access to the file system (subject to normal file system
permissions).

When running a workflow on a remote server, accessing files local to the workflow's Python kernel isn't helpful
because they're on a server that the workstation's Cytoscape can't reach. Additionally, it's problematic to allow
the Python kernel to access workstation files anyway because 1) errant notebooks could compromise workstation
security, and 2) notebooks can't easily account for differences in various workstation file systems (e.g.,
naming files in a Mac is different than in Windows).

Sandboxing solves this by creating a workstation directory that's guaranteed to exist. The notebook can create and
access files within the sandbox (by using the sandbox_* functions in this module), and Cytoscape can do the same.
When a workflow runs remotely, py4cytoscape automatically creates a default sandbox for this data flow.

While workflows running on a Cytoscape workstation have access to the entire workstation file system, they can opt
to use a sandbox instead. This allows workflows to be developed on a workstation, then moved to a remote server and
executed there. (See the sandbox_set() function.)

It's possible for a workflow to use the default sandbox or (instead) create a custom sandbox for the exclusive use
of a workflow or family of workflows.

    A sandbox is the root for the file system used for all file operations. When running a workflow
    from a command line or notebook on the same workstation as Cytoscape, the default sandbox is the
    entire workstation file system, and the current directory is the same as the Python kernel's
    default directory. When running a workflow on a remote server, the default sandbox is the
    'default_sandbox' created automatically under the under the ``filetransfer`` directory in the
    CytoscapeConfiguration directory. Naming a custom sandbox with this sandbox_set() function
    creates a new sub-directory as a sibling to 'default_sandbox' and uses it for subsequent
    file operations. Setting a None sandbox reverts to the workstation's file system when the
    workflow is running on the Cytoscape workstation, and 'default_sandbox' when the workflow is
    running remotely.

    Sandboxes are highly recommended as an aid to creating workflows that can be shared with
    others.

    """Remove a file from a sandbox.

    The named file is removed from the named sandbox. If the sandbox is the entire file system (i.e., for standalone
    Python execution), the file name can be an absolute path. Otherwise, it is a path relative to the named sandbox.

    Note that there is no function that deletes a directory, except for ``sandbox_remove()``, which deletes a sandbox
    and all of its contents.

    Args:
        file_name (str): Name of file to delete (as absolute path or sandbox-relative path)
        sandbox_name (str): Name of sandbox containing file. None means "the current sandbox".
        base_url (str): Ignore unless you need to specify a custom domain,
            port or version to connect to the CyREST API. Default is http://localhost:1234
            and the latest version of the CyREST API supported by this version of py4cytoscape.

    Returns:
        dict: {'filePath': <file's absolute path in Cytoscape workstation>, 'existed': True if file existed before being deleted}

    Raises:
        CyError: if file name is invalid
        requests.exceptions.HTTPError: if can't connect to Cytoscape, Cytoscape returns an error, or sandbox is invalid

    Examples:
        >>> sandbox_remove_file('test.png')
        {'filePath': 'C:\\Users\\CyDeveloper\\default_sandbox\\test.png', 'existed': True}
        >>> sandbox_remove_file('mySamples/workspace.cys', sandbox_name='mySand')
        {'filePath': 'C:\\Users\\CyDeveloper\\mySand\\mySamples\\workspace.cys', 'existed': False}
