# Dawarich Python API

A python wrapper for [Dawarich](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich) (no official association).

This repository contains a Python client for interacting with the Dawarich API. The client provides methods to post location data and retrieve statistics from the API. It is still experimental, but it should work, with the reservation for breaking changes.
