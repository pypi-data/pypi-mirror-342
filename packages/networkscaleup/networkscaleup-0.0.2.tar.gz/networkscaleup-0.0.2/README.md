This package fits several different **Network Scale-Up Models (NSUM)** to **Aggregated Relational Data (ARD)**. ARD represents survey responses to questions of the form: *"How many X’s do you know?"*, where respondents report how many people they know in different subpopulations.

Specifically, if Nᵢ respondents are asked about Nₖ subpopulations, then the ARD is an Nᵢ times Nₖ matrix, where the *(i, j)* element represents how many people respondent *i* reports knowing in subpopulation *j*.

NSUM leverages these responses to estimate the unknown size of **hard-to-reach populations**.
