# HHI GDSFactory PDK 6.19.2

This PDK harnesses the full power of **GDSFactory+**, providing advanced tools for photonic design, including:

- **Simulations**: Seamlessly integrate and run photonic simulations.
- **Design Rule Checking (DRC)**: Ensure your designs meet fabrication requirements.
- **Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)**: Verify that your layouts match the intended schematics.

## **Prerequisites**
This PDK requires an active **GDSFactory+** subscription.
For subscription details, please contact [**contact@gdsfactory.com**](mailto:contact@gdsfactory.com) or visit [**gdsfactory.com**](https://gdsfactory.com/).

## **Getting Started**

To begin using:

- You can see the Getting started guide in the [docs](https://gdsfactory.com/plus/) and the videos.
