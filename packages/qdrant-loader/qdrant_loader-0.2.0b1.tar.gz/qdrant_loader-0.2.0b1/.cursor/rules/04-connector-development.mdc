# Connector Development Guidelines

## Connector Structure

Each connector should be placed in [src/qdrant_loader/connectors](mdc:src/qdrant_loader/connectors) and follow these guidelines:

- Implement both connector and change detection logic
- Follow the base connector interface
- Include comprehensive testing
- Implement proper error handling

## Base Classes

Connectors should inherit from these base classes:
```python
from qdrant_loader.connectors.base import BaseConnector, BaseChangeDetector

class CustomConnector(BaseConnector):
    """Custom connector implementation."""
    pass

class CustomChangeDetector(BaseChangeDetector):
    """Custom change detection implementation."""
    pass
```

## Required Features

Each connector must implement:
- Document ingestion
- Change detection
- State management integration
- Incremental updates
- Error handling and recovery

## Testing Requirements

Connectors must include tests for:
- Basic functionality
- Change detection
- Error handling
- State management integration
- Incremental ingestion

For detailed connector development guidelines, refer to [CodingStandards.md](mdc:docs/CodingStandards.md)
