# Chercher

**Chercher** is a universal, extensible, and personal search engine. With it you can easily index and query documents, webpages, RSS feeds, and much more, as long as a plugin is available. Chercher is being develop to be simple to use, customize, and maintain, all while trying to be as fast and efficient as possible.

## Features

Building a personal search engine has been a long-standing goal of mine, but I struggled to create something I was truly satisfied with. Almost a year ago, I gave my first try with [winzig], (...). After some trial and error, I decided to take another approach with [housaku]. However, I became overly ambitious, and with life's getting in the way among other things, I ultimately set that project aside. Fortunately, I learned a fair bit about search engines, ranking algorithms, and what to do (and what not do). So, with all of this in mind, the most important features of Chercher are:

1. Plugins, plugins, plugins everywhere:
2. SQLite's FTS5:
3. BM25:
4. Progressive indexing:
5. An easy to use CLI:
6. An easy to use TUI:
