# Audio2Face 3D Authoring

NVIDIA Audio2Face-3D Authoring is a component of NVIDIA ACE,
delivering real-time face and emotion parameters tweaking using generative AI.
The Audio2Face-3D Authoring microservice is complementary to Audio2Face-3D Microservice.
This solution allows you to determine an optimal set of parameters for Audio2Face-3D 
Microservice.
This microservice supports multiple client simultaneously, enabling workflows that 
allow many users to connect and generate animation frames at the same time.
