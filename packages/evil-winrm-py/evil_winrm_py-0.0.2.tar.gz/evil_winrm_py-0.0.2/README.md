# evil-winrm-py

Rewrite of popular tool evil-winrm in python

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityatelange/evil-winrm-py/refs/heads/main/assets/terminal.png)

## Motivation

The original evil-winrm is written in Ruby, which can be a hurdle for some users. Rewriting it in Python makes it more accessible and easier to use, while also allowing us to leverage Pythonâ€™s rich ecosystem for added features and flexibility.

I also wanted to learn more about winrm and its internals, so this project will also serve as a learning experience for me.

```bash
pipx install evil-winrm-py
```
