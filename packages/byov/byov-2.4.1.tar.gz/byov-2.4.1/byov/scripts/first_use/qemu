# Following https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address each host should
# define a unique prefix setting at least the local bit (aka
# 02:00:00:00:00:00). Each guest can then use its process id to populate the
# NIC (the last 3 bytes) part to obtain a unique MAC address. That means
# 256**3 (16.777.216) possible addresses per host.
