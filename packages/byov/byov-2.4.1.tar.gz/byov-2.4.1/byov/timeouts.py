class ExponentialBackoff(object):
    """Provides wait times summing up to a limit.

    When an operation can fail transiently, it can be retried several times
    until it succeeds up to a specified limit. The returned values are the
    successive wait times and their total equals ``up_to``.

    :note: The total of the returned times will be ``up_to``. This mimics
        manual retries by a user re-trying randomly but giving up after a
        limit.

    :note: To simplify use by callers doing a loop around attempt/sleep, the
        last value is always zero so no time is wasted waiting after the last
        failed attempt.
