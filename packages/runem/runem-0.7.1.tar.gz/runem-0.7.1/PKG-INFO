# Highlights
## Blueprint of Commands:
The blueprint (available via `--help`) gives you a manifest of all jobs and tasks in a
project. A single source of truth for all tasks.
## Parallel Execution:
Maximise speed with automatic concurrency. Runem tries to run all tasks as quickly as
possible, looking at resources, with dependencies. It is not yet a full
dependency-execution graph, but by version 1.0.0 it will be.
## Filtering:
Use powerful and flexible filtering. Select or excluded tasks by `tags`, `name` and
`phase`. Chose the task to be run based on your needs, right now.

You can also customise filtering by adding your own command `options`.

See `--tags`, `--not-tags`, `--jobs`, `--not-jobs`, `--phases` and `--not-phases`.
## Powerful Insights:** Understand what ran, how fast, and what failed.
**Quiet by Default:** Focus on what matters, and reveal detail only when needed.

# Quick Start
**Install:**
```bash
pip install runem
```
**Define a task:**

```yaml
`# .runem.yml
 - job:
    command: echo "hello world!"
```

**Run:**

```bash
runem
```

Run multiple commands in parallel, see timing, and keep output minimal. Need detail?

```bash
runem --verbose
```
