### New Feature: Token Profiler: Optimize Your AI Prompt Efficiency
The Token Profiler is a vital feature of DoCoreAI designed to analyze and optimize the efficiency of your AI prompts. By evaluating token usage, it helps identify and reduce unnecessary verbosity, leading to cost savings and improved performance.

Key Features:
Token Count Analysis: Calculates the total number of tokens in your prompt to ensure it aligns with model constraints.​  

**Cost Estimation:** Provides an estimated cost per API call based on token usage, aiding in budget management.​  

**Bloat Score Assessment:** Assigns a 'bloat score' to measure prompt verbosity, helping to flag and refine overly verbose prompts.​  

**Optimization Insights:** Highlights potential savings by optimizing prompts, offering actionable recommendations for efficiency.  

How It Works:  
The Token Profiler evaluates your prompt by:​  

1. Counting Tokens: Determines the number of tokens in the input prompt.​
GitHub  

2. Estimating Costs: Calculates the approximate cost associated with the prompt based on token pricing.​  

3. Assessing Bloat Score: Analyzes the prompt's verbosity to assign a bloat score, indicating potential areas for reduction.​  

4. Suggesting Optimizations: Provides insights into possible cost savings through prompt refinement.  

Example Output:
```
{
  "token_count": 67,
  "estimated_cost": "$0.000101",
  "bloat_score": 1.12,
  "bloat_flag": true,
  "estimated_savings_if_optimized": "$0.000030",
  "estimated_savings%_if_optimized": "30%"
}  
```

In this example, the prompt contains 67 tokens with an estimated cost of $0.000101. The bloat score of 1.12 indicates minimal verbosity, suggesting no immediate need for optimization.​

By integrating the Token Profiler into your workflow, you can ensure that your AI prompts are concise, cost-effective, and performance-optimized.

## ⚠️ Important: DoCoreAI’s Token Usage—Read Before You Judge!  

**Why DoCoreAI May Seem to Use More Tokens Initially**
When you first test DoCoreAI, you might notice higher completion tokens compared to a normal LLM prompt. This is expected because:

DoCoreAI dynamically adjusts AI behavior based on reasoning, creativity, and precision.  

It optimizes response quality upfront, reducing unnecessary follow-up queries.  
🔍 But Here’s How DoCoreAI Actually Saves Costs  
✔️ Fewer follow-up API calls: A well-optimized first response means users don’t need to rephrase their questions.  
✔️ Controlled AI behavior: Instead of AI generating unpredictable outputs, DoCoreAI ensures response efficiency.  
✔️ Smart token optimization: Over multiple queries, total tokens used decrease compared to standard LLM prompts.

📊 What Should You Do?  
🔹 **Don’t judge cost based on a single query—test**  
🔹 Compare total token usage over time, not just one response.  
🔹 Measure the reduction in API calls for a real cost-benefit analysis.  

Note: The current output appends extra content "intelligence_profile": { "reasoning": 0.5, "creativity": 0.2, "precision": 0.9, "temperature": 0.4}, which currently adds up the total tokens. This output text can be simply ignored in the PROD version, to save on tokens.  

### ⚡ DoCoreAI isn’t just about using optimizing temperature or tokens—it’s about making AI smarter and more cost-effective.  
🚀 **Test it right, and you’ll see the difference!**

## Recommended LLMs for Intelligence Optimization
DoCoreAI is designed to refine and optimize user prompts by dynamically adjusting intelligence parameters such as reasoning, creativity, and precision. To achieve the best results, we recommend using ChatGPT (GPT-4-turbo) for this task.
While DoCoreAI is compatible with other LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3, Claude etc), results may vary depending on the model’s capabilities. Developers are encouraged to experiment and contribute insights on different LLM integrations.

## 📌 Technical Note: Token Usage & API Efficiency
- Our Testing & Research shows that token usage is reduced by 15-30% when compared to normal prompts, leading to:
    Lower API Costs – Reduced token consumption means lower expenses when using OpenAI or Groq models.

**Proposed Enhancement: Vector Database Integration**  
We are currently exploring the integration of a vector database to store intelligence profiles for past queries. This will probably enable faster retrieval of optimized parameters for similar prompts, further reducing token usage and improving response efficiency. Stay tuned!

**Future Support for Fine-Tuned Models:**  
We recognize the growing demand for fine-tuned open-source models tailored for specific applications. In future updates, we aim to explore Integration with fine-tuned LLaMA/Custom GPT models, Support for locally deployed models (via Ollama, vLLM, etc.) & Customization of intelligence parameters based on domain-specific data.

Our vision is to make DoCoreAI adaptable to both proprietary and open-source AI models, ensuring flexibility for all developers. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
