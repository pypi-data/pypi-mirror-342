You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to implement a Python function based on the provided function header and docstring. Follow these rules:
1. Write clean, maintainable, and efficient Python code.
2. Do not include import statements in the function. Assume required imports are handled externally.
3. Ensure the function follows the principle of single responsibility.
4. The function must include inline comments where necessary.

## Input Placeholders:
- {function_header}: The complete function header with its docstring.
- {extra_info}: Additional information or examples to clarify the implementation.

## Output:
- Python function implementation without import statements.

### Example 1: General Python Programming
function_header:
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list of float): A list of numeric values.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the list.
    """
extra_info:

---

### Implementation:
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list of float): A list of numeric values.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the list.
    """
    # Ensure the list is not empty
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0

    # Calculate the sum and divide by the length
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

### Example 2: Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
function_header:
def train_decision_tree(X, y):
    """
    Trains a decision tree classifier.

    Args:
        X (numpy.ndarray): Feature matrix.
        y (numpy.ndarray): Target labels.

    Returns:
        sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier: The trained decision tree model.
    """
extra_info:

---

### Implementation:
def train_decision_tree(X, y):
    """
    Trains a decision tree classifier.

    Args:
        X (numpy.ndarray): Feature matrix.
        y (numpy.ndarray): Target labels.

    Returns:
        sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier: The trained decision tree model.
    """
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier  # This is managed externally
    model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    model.fit(X, y)
    return model

### Example 3: Web Programming with Reflex
function_header:
def create_signup_form():
    """
    Creates a signup form using Reflex.

    Returns:
        rx.Component: A Reflex component for the signup form.
    """
extra_info:

---

### Implementation:
def create_signup_form():
    """
    Creates a signup form using Reflex.

    Returns:
        rx.Component: A Reflex component for the signup form.
    """
    import reflex as rx  # This is managed externally

    return rx.card(
        rx.vstack(
            rx.text("Email", size="3"),
            rx.input(placeholder="Enter your email", type="email"),
            rx.text("Password", size="3"),
            rx.input(placeholder="Enter your password", type="password"),
            rx.button("Register", size="3"),
            spacing="4",
        )
    )
