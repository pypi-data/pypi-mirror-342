A Python package that provides a Playwright-based scraper implementation for The Pudim Hunter platform. This package extends the `pudim-hunter-driver` interface to provide a common base for implementing job board scrapers.

## Features

* Playwright-based web scraping
* Async support for better performance
* Headless browser automation
* Easy-to-extend base classes for job board implementations
* Built-in error handling and resource management
* Type hints and validation using Pydantic

## Usage

### Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
# Install directly using pip
pip install pudim-hunter-driver-scraper

# Or add to your requirements.txt
pudim-hunter-driver-scraper>=0.0.1  # Replace with the version you need
```

For development installations, see the Development section.

### Interface Overview

This package provides the base scraper implementation for job search drivers. To create a scraper for a specific job board, you'll need to extend the `ScraperJobDriver` class and implement the required methods.

1. `ScraperJobDriver` (ABC) - The base scraper class that implements `JobDriver`:
   * `async build_search_url(query: JobQuery) -> str`
   * `def get_selectors() -> Dict[str, str]`
   * `def transform_data(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[Job]`

2. `PlaywrightScraper` - The base scraper implementation:
   * Supports both sync and async operations
   * Handles browser lifecycle
   * Provides navigation and data extraction methods

3. Exceptions:
   * Inherits all exceptions from `pudim-hunter-driver`
   * Adds scraper-specific error handling

## Installation

From PyPI:
```bash
pip install pudim-hunter-driver-scraper
```

From source:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:luismr/pudim-hunter-driver-scraper.git
cd pudim-hunter-driver-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Virtual Environment Setup

We strongly recommend using a virtual environment for development and testing. This isolates the project dependencies from your system Python packages.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)
* venv module (usually comes with Python 3)

### macOS and Linux

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd pudim-hunter-driver-scraper
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3.9 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .  # for development
```

5. Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

6. To deactivate when done:
```bash
deactivate
```

### Windows

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd pudim-hunter-driver-scraper
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
* In Command Prompt:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
* In PowerShell:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .  # for development
```

5. Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

6. To deactivate when done:
```bash
deactivate
```

### Troubleshooting

#### macOS/Linux

* If `python3.9` is not found, install it using your package manager:
  * macOS (with Homebrew): `brew install python@3.9`
  * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python39 python39-venv`
  * CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install python39 python39-devel`

#### Windows

* Ensure Python is added to your PATH during installation
* If PowerShell execution policy prevents activation:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Development

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Pudim Hunter Driver Scraper as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

### Getting Started
