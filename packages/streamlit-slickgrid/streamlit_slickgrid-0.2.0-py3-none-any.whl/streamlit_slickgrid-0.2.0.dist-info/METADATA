IMPORTANT: This is not an officially-maintained package by Streamlit. We built this to "scratch our own itch" with some internal Finance folks who needed it for their apps. Consider this a community project, for all intents and purposes. That said, we think it's awesome :)

```sh
pip install streamlit-slickgrid
```
