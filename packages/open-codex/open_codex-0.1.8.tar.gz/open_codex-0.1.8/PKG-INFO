# Ghost in the Shell

**Ghost in the Shell** is a cross-platform command-line assistant that lets you use natural language to run shell commands. Whether you‚Äôre on macOS, Linux, or Windows, just type what you want to do ‚Äî AI Shell will suggest the correct shell command, ask for your confirmation, and optionally execute it.

Supports both:
- **One-shot mode**: `ai "archive.tar"` ‚Üí returns shell command
- **Interactive mode**: `ai -i` ‚Üí opens a terminal chat with the AI
