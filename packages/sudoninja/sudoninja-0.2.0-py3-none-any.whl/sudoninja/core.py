def generate_sudoku(block_size=3, cells_to_remove=40, verbose=False, premade_blocks=None, is_multi_sudoku=False):
    """
    Generates a Sudoku puzzle and its corresponding solution.

    This function creates either a standard Sudoku puzzle or a complex multi-sudoku puzzle based on the parameters.
    It supports injecting pre-defined blocks into the grid (for corner embedding or special cases) and can be used
    both for independent puzzles and as part of a larger composite puzzle (e.g., multi-sudoku).

    Parameters:
    -----------
    block_size : int, optional (default=3)
        The size of a single block (sub-grid) in the puzzle. A block_size of 3 generates a standard 9x9 grid.

    cells_to_remove : int, optional (default=40)
        The number of cells to remove from the completed grid in order to form the final puzzle. 
        This controls the puzzle’s difficulty.

    verbose : bool, optional (default=False)
        If True, enables verbose logging of the generation process.

    premade_blocks : dict, optional (default=None) (only applied if not multi sudoku for now, but can 100% be improved by a ninja)
        A dictionary specifying pre-filled blocks to be embedded into the puzzle before generation.
        The keys are (block_row, block_col) positions (0-indexed), and the values are 2D lists representing 
        full sub-grids (e.g., 3x3 if block_size=3) to place at those locations.

        Example:
        --------
        premade_blocks = {
            (0, 0): [
                [5, 0, 0],
                [0, 7, 0],
                [0, 0, 1]
            ]
        }

    is_multi_sudoku : bool, optional (default=False)
        If True, generates a full multi-sudoku puzzle layout instead of a single 9x9 grid. 
        Delegates puzzle creation to `create_multi_sudoku`.

    Returns:
    --------
    tuple of (puzzle, solution):
        - puzzle : list of lists
            The generated Sudoku puzzle with some numbers removed.
        - solution : list of lists
            The complete solution for the generated puzzle.

    Notes:
    ------
    - If `is_multi_sudoku=True`, the function ignores `premade_blocks` and returns a combined multi-grid directly.
    - The internal validity of the puzzle is preserved during removal of cells, ensuring the puzzle remains solvable.

    Example Usage:
    --------------
    puzzle, solution = generate_sudoku(
        block_size=3,
        cells_to_remove=40,

def create_multi_sudoku(block_size=3, cells_to_remove=40, verbose=False):
    """
    Creates a multi-sudoku puzzle composed of five interconnected Sudoku grids.

    This function generates a complex puzzle structure where four smaller sudoku puzzles
    are placed in the corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), and a central
    sudoku puzzle sits in the middle. These five grids are partially linked through shared blocks:
    - The corner puzzles each include one pre-filled 3x3 block taken from the central puzzle's solution.
    - These shared blocks ensure interdependence between the five grids, creating a unique and challenging puzzle layout.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    block_size : int, optional (default=3)
        The size of a single block in each sudoku grid. A value of 3 produces standard 9x9 sudoku puzzles.

    cells_to_remove : int, optional (default=40)
        The number of cells to remove from each generated puzzle, controlling the difficulty level.

    verbose : bool, optional (default=False)
        If True, enables verbose output from the puzzle generation process for debugging or inspection.

    Returns:
    --------
    combined : list of lists
        A 2D grid representing the full multi-sudoku layout with five interlinked puzzles.
        The combined layout is larger than a standard sudoku grid and follows this structure:

def print_grid(grid, block_size, is_multi_sudoku=False):
    """
    Prints a formatted grid to the console.

    This function takes a grid (list of lists), formats it in a structured way, and prints the content to the console.
    The grid will be divided into blocks of size `block_size` by `block_size`, with special formatting for the values:
    - Values that are `0` are displayed as a dot (`.`).
    - Values that are `"X"` are displayed as `XX`.
    - Other values are displayed normally, padded to a width of 2 characters for neatness.
    The grid will be wrapped in horizontal lines (`+---+---+...`) for visual clarity, and vertical bars (`|`) separate the blocks.
    
    Additionally, if the `is_multi_sudoku` flag is set to `True`, the grid will be formatted for a multi-sudoku layout,
    where additional filler spaces are inserted to separate blocks for a larger grid. This is useful when working with
    multi-sudoku or larger puzzle structures that include multiple grids.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    grid : list of list
        The 2D list that represents the grid, where each element is either a number or a special character like `"X"`.
        Example:
        [
            [1, 2, 3, 0],
            [4, 5, 6, 0],
            [7, 8, 9, 'X'],
            [0, 0, 0, 0]
        ]
        
    block_size : int
        The size of the blocks in the grid. It determines how large each block is. 
        For example, `block_size=3` means a 9x9 grid.

    is_multi_sudoku : bool, optional (default=False)
        A flag to indicate if the grid is part of a multi-sudoku layout. If `True`, the grid will be formatted with additional
        filler spaces to separate the blocks for multi-sudoku puzzles. This is typically used for puzzles that have multiple
        grids (e.g., larger or concatenated sudoku grids).

    Example usage:
    --------------
    grid = [
        [1, 2, 3, 0],
        [4, 5, 6, 0],
        [7, 8, 9, 'X'],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
    print_grid(grid, 3, is_multi_sudoku=True)
    
    This will print the grid in a nicely formatted structure to the console, with additional filler spaces if multi-sudoku.

    Output:
    -------
    A formatted grid will be printed to the console with horizontal lines, vertical bars, and properly formatted values.
    If `is_multi_sudoku` is `True`, the grid will include additional filler spaces between blocks for a multi-sudoku layout.

    Saves a formatted grid to a text file, auto-creating folders and appending '.txt' if missing.

    This function takes a grid (list of lists), formats it in a structured way, and writes it to a text file.
    It divides the grid into blocks of size `block_size` by `block_size`, and optionally adds extra spacing for 
    multi-sudoku layouts (i.e., concatenated or composite sudoku grids).

    Enhancements:
    -------------
    - If the `filename` includes directories that don't exist, they will be created automatically.
    - If the `filename` does not include a file extension, `.txt` is appended automatically.

    Formatting Rules:
    -----------------
    - Values equal to `0` are shown as a dot (`.`).
    - Values equal to `"X"` (case-insensitive) are shown as `XX`.
    - All other values are shown padded to two characters (e.g., ` 7`, `10`).
    - Horizontal lines (`+---+---+...`) separate block rows.
    - Vertical bars (`|`) separate block columns.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    grid : list of list
        The 2D list representing the grid. Each element is a number, zero, or a special character like `"X"`.

    block_size : int
        Size of one block in the grid. For example, `block_size=3` is used for standard 9x9 Sudoku.

    filename : str, optional (default="combined_grid.txt")
        Name (and optional path) of the file where the grid will be saved.

    is_multi_sudoku : bool, optional (default=False)
        If set to True, assumes the grid is a multi-sudoku (composed of multiple sudoku blocks) and adjusts the formatting accordingly.

    overwrite_existing : bool, optional (default=False)
        If True, will overwrite the file if it already exists.
        If False, will automatically rename the file to avoid overwriting,
        using the format: "filename_previous_1.txt", "filename_previous_2.txt", etc.

    Example:
    --------
    grid = [
        [1, 2, 3, 0],
        [4, 5, 6, 0],
        [7, 8, 9, 'X'],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
    save_grid_to_file(grid, 3, "saves/output_grid", is_multi_sudoku=True)

    Output:
    -------
    A file will be created with the formatted grid content.
    The absolute path of the saved file will be printed to the console.

# also, i dont enforce uniqueness in solutions, as most sudoku generation engines seem to do.
# this makes it way simpler and for my use is not a problem, but feel free to PR if you can code it!
