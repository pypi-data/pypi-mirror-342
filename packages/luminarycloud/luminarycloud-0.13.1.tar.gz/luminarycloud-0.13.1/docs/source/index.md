# Luminary Cloud SDK (vLATEST_VERSION)

```{include} ./early-access.md
```

This site contains tutorials, documentation, and release notes for the Luminary
Cloud Python SDK.

Luminary Cloudâ€™s Python Software Development Kit (SDK) allows you to access many
of the features within our platform programmatically (i.e. without needing to
go through the graphical user interface in your browser).

Our Python SDK provides a secure abstraction layer, a set of simulation-specific
data structures, and all the necessary functionality to enable automation via
simple Python scripts.

It allows you to create your own applications leveraging Luminary (such as
importing geometry and creating meshes, running and post-processing simulations,
running explorations and creating surrogate models) and connect Luminary
simulations to pre- and post-processing tools that are already part of your own
workflows.

The sample code below shows how the SDK can be used to upload a mesh and run a
simulation (note that the Python SDK is designated as Early Access and syntax
and functionality may change significantly).

```py
import luminarycloud as lc
project = lc.create_project("NACA 0012", "My first SDK project.")
mesh = project.upload_mesh("./airfoil.lcmesh")
sim_template = project.create_simulation_template("test template", "./simulation_template.json")
sim = project.create_simulation(mesh.id, "My simulation", sim_template.id)
```
