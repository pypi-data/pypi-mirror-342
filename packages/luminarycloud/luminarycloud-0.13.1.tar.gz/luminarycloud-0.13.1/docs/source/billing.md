# Billing

There is no additional cost to use the Luminary API and Python SDK.

The resource usage incurred by API calls will be billed as described in the
[Luminary Cloud Service Consumption
Table](http://legal.luminarycloud.com/consumption.html).

Not all API calls will result in billable resource usage. For example
[`get_project`](#luminarycloud.project.get_project) simply retrieves a project
resource and does not consume any billable compute, storage, or networking
resources.

The [Luminary Cloud Service Consumption
Table](http://legal.luminarycloud.com/consumption.html) is the definitive source
of billing information. If you have more questions about how API usage is
billed, please contact us at
[support@luminarycloud.com](mailto:support@luminarycloud.com).
