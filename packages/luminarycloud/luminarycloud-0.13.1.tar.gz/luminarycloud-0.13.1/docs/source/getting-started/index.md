# Getting Started

There are two options for getting started with the Luminary Cloud
Python SDK:

1. The [Python SDK Quickstart](quickstart.md#quickstart-with-python-notebook) tutorial will show you how to use a containerized Python environment with the Luminary Cloud SDK
pre-installed to access a sample notebook in your web browser. This is the fastest way to starting writing and executing code to run simulations.
2. [Install the Luminary Cloud Python SDK](setup-dev-environment.md) and write Python scripts in your preferred Python environment or in a virtual environment (recommended).

:::{Important}
If you're new to using our platform, before getting started with our SDK, you
must log in to Luminary Cloud via your browser and accept the terms and
conditions.
