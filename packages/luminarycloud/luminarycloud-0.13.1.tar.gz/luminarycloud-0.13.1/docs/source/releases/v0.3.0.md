## Migration Guide

Upgrading to this SDK version will not require any code changes to your existing
scripts, but any simulation parameter JSON files previously downloaded from the
web app will no longer work. You will need to re-download them in order to
create new simulations. You can do this by opening the desired project in the
[web app](https://app.luminarycloud.com) and selecting `Download simulation
parameters (API use only)` in the "More options" menu of the right-hand sidebar.

No other changes or migration steps are necessary for this release.
