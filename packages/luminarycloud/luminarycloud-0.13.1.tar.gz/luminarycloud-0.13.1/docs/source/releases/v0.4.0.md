installed SDK version.

## Release Notes

This SDK release contains several quality-of-life improvements related to
downloading large files and managing project storage usage.

This is a **required** upgrade for all users, you will not be able to use the
API with older versions of the SDK.

### Features

- Leveraging cloud technology, we have greatly increased the download speed
for [`Simulation.download_surface_solution()`](#luminarycloud.simulation.Simulation.download_surface_solution)
and [`Simulation.download_volume_solution()`](#luminarycloud.simulation.Simulation.download_volume_solution)
- A new `storage_usage_bytes: int` field has been added to the
[`Project`](#luminarycloud.project.Project) resource so you can keep track of
how much storage each project is using.

### Bug Fixes

- No bug fixes in this SDK release.
