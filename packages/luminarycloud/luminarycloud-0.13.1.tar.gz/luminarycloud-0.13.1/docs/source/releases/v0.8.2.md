## Release Notes

This is a backwards compatible SDK release that contains some performance
improvements and bug fixes. We recommend all customers upgrade to this release.

### Features

- The performance of `upload_mesh` has been improved to increase upload speeds.
- A new `existing_solution_id` field has been added to the `InitializationFluid`
and `InitializationHeat` parameters. This new field can be used to initialize a
new simulation from a previously computed solution.

### Bug Fixes

A bug that caused a default mesh name to be used, even when the optional `name`
parameter to `upload_mesh` was provided, has been fixed.
