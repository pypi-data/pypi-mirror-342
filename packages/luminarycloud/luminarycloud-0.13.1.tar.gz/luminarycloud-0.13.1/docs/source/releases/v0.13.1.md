## Release Notes

This is a small release with no breaking changes and a couple new features.

### Features

- A [`copy()`](#luminarycloud.Geometry.copy) method has been added to [`Geometry`](#luminarycloud.Geometry) for creating a copy of a geometry.
- An experimental flag [`use_wrap`](#luminarycloud.meshing.MeshGenerationParams.use_wrap) has been added to [`MeshGenerationParams`](#luminarycloud.meshing.MeshGenerationParams).
- A new filter [`Isosurface`](#luminarycloud.vis.Isosurface) has been added to the `vis` module.

### Bug Fixes / Improvements

- [`vis.Scene`](#luminarycloud.vis.Scene) will now correctly get tags for a mesh's geometry when rendering a mesh that was produced from a geometry.
