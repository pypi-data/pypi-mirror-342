# TopDownHockey EliteProspects Scraper

## By Patrick Bacon, made possible by the work of Marcus Sj√∂lin and Harry Shomer.

---

This is a package built for scraping two data sources:

1. The NHL's Play-by-Play Reports, which come in the form of HTML/API reports from the NHL and JSON reports from ESPN.

2. Elite Prospects, an extremely valuable website which makes hockey data for thousands of leagues available to the public. 

This package is strictly built for end users who wish to scrape data for personal use. If you are interested in using Elite Prospects data for professional purposes, I recommend you look into the <a href="https://www.eliteprospects.com/api" >Elite Prospects API</a>.

While using the scraper, please be mindful of EliteProspects servers.

# Installation

    </ul>

Example:

Say you obtain skater data for the KHL in 2020-2021 and store that as a dataframe called <code>output</code>. You can run this function to get bio information for every player in that league's scrape.

<code>output = tdhepscrape.get_skaters("khl", "2020-2021")</code>

<code>tdhepscrape.get_player_information(output)</code>

---

### add_player_information(dataframe)

Example:

Say you obtain skater data for the KHL in 2020-2021 and store that as a dataframe called <code>output</code>. You can run this function to get bio information for every player in that league's scrape.

<code>output = tdhepscrape.get_skaters("khl", "2020-2021")</code>

<code>tdhepscrape.add_player_information(output)</code>

My goal was to make this package as error-proof as possible. I believe I've accounted for every issue that could potentially throw off a scrape, but it's possible I've missed something.

If any issues arise, or you have any questions about the package, please do not hesitate to contact me on Twitter at @TopDownHockey or email me directly at patrick.s.bacon@gmail.com.
