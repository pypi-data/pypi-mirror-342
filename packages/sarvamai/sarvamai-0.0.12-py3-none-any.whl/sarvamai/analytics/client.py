            For `enum` type questions, include an 'options' list in the properties.

        hotwords : typing.Optional[str]
            Optional comma-separated string of keywords specific to your domain. These keywords will be preserved as-is in the transcript.

        model : typing.Optional[SpeechToTextTranslateModel]
            Model to be used for converting speech to text in target language

        with_diarization : typing.Optional[bool]
            Include diarization in the output

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
