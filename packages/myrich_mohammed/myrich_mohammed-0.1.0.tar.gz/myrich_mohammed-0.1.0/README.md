# My_first_lib

**Hi!!**  
This is my first lib, so I'm testing things.  
This lib does two things for now (2025/4/18):

1. **rich_input**  
   It lets you color the input message.

2. **show_all_colors**  
   It shows all colors you can use (total 256).

It depends on the [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) lib, and I made this lib just to increase speed.
