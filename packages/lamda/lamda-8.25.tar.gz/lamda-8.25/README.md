<p align="center">With the rise of intelligent machines, the popularity of traditional web pages has significantly weakened, and data and applications are accelerating their shift to mobile platforms. As mobile devices become more widespread, traditional web content models face reassessment, and automation and data collection technologies urgently need to adapt to this trend. While past data and automation tools focused on web content, conventional technologies now face new challenges in the mobile environment. FIRERPA has created possibilities to make all of this simpler and more efficient.</p>
