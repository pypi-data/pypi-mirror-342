                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Project Description

GRID2DEMAND: A tool for generating zone-to-zone travel demand based on grid cells or TAZs and gravity model

## Introduction

Grid2demand is an open-source quick demand generation tool based on the trip generation and trip distribution methods of the standard 4-step travel model.

By taking advantage of OSM2GMNS tool to obtain route-able transportation network from OpenStreetMap, Grid2demand aims to further utilize Point of Interest (POI) data to construct trip demand matrix aligned with standard travel models.

You can find base-knowledge tutorial with the link: [Base Knowledge such as transportation 4 stages planning](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/grid2demand/tree/main/docs)

You can find the tutorial code witht the link: [How To Use Grid2demand](https://github.com/xyluo25/grid2demand/tree/main/tutorial)

## Installation

```python
pip install grid2demand
```

If you meet installation issues, please reach out to our [developers](mailto:luoxiangyong01@gmail.com) for solutions.

## Demand Generation

[!IMPORTANT]
node.csv and poi.csv should follow the [GMNS](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS) standard and you can generate node.csv and poi.csv using [osm2gmns](https://osm2gmns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html).

### Generate demands from node.csv and poi.csv (zone_id as activity nodes)

1. Create zone from node.csv (the boundary of nodes), this will generate grid cells (num_x_blocks, num_y_blocks, or x length and y length in km for each grid cell)
2. Generate demands for between zones (utilize nodes and pois)

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import
import grid2demand as gd

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Specify input directory
    input_dir = "your-data-folder"

    # Initialize a GRID2DEMAND object
    net = gd.GRID2DEMAND(input_dir=input_dir, use_zone_id=True, mode_type="auto")

    # load network: node and poi
    net.load_network()

    # Generate zone.csv from node boundary by specifying number of x blocks and y blocks
    net.net2grid(num_x_blocks=10, num_y_blocks=10)
    # net.net2grid(cell_width=10, cell_height=10, unit="km")

    # Load zone from zone.csv
    net.taz2zone()

    # Map zones with nodes and pois, viseversa
    net.map_mapping_between_zone_and_node_poi()

    # Calculate zone-to-zone distance matrix
    net.calc_zone_od_distance_matrix(pct=1)

    # Calculate demand by running gravity model
    net.run_gravity_model()

    # Save demand, zone, updated node, updated poi to csv
    net.save_results_to_csv(agent=True, overwrite_file=False)
```

### Generate demands from node.csv, poi.csv and zone.csv (from TAZ)

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import
import grid2demand as gd

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Specify input directory
    input_dir = "your-data-folder"

    # Initialize a GRID2DEMAND object
    net = gd.GRID2DEMAND(input_dir=input_dir, use_zone_id=True, mode_type="auto")

    # Load network: node and poi
    net.load_network()

    # Load zone from zone.csv
    net.taz2zone()

    # Map zones with nodes and pois, viseversa
    net.map_mapping_between_zone_and_node_poi()

    # Calculate zone-to-zone distance matrix
    net.calc_zone_od_distance_matrix(pct=1)

    # Calculate demand by running gravity model
    net.run_gravity_model()

    # Save demand, zone, updated node, updated poi to csv
    net.save_results_to_csv(node=Frale, zone=False, agent=False, overwrite_file=False)
```
