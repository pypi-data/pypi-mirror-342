# 📦 Repomix (Python Version)

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

## 🎯 1. Introduction

Repomix is a powerful tool that packs your entire repository into a single, AI-friendly file. It's perfect for when you need to feed your codebase to Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

The original [Repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) is written in JavaScript, and this is the ported Python version.

## ⭐ 2. Features

-   **AI-Optimized**: Formats your codebase in a way that's easy for AI to understand and process.
-   **Token Counting**: Provides token counts for each file and the entire repository using tiktoken.
-   **Simple to Use**: Pack your entire repository with just one command.
-   **Customizable**: Easily configure what to include or exclude.
-   **Git-Aware**: Automatically respects your .gitignore files.
-   **Security-Focused**: Built-in security checks to detect and prevent the inclusion of sensitive information.

## 🚀 3. Quick Start

You can install Repomix using pip:

```bash
pip install repomix
```

Then run in any project directory:

```bash
python -m repomix
```

That's it! Repomix will generate a `repomix-output.md` file in your current directory, containing your entire repository in an AI-friendly format.

## 📖 4. Usage

### 4.1 Command Line Usage

To pack your entire repository:

```bash
python -m repomix
```

To pack a specific directory:

```bash
python -m repomix path/to/directory
```

To pack a remote repository:

```bash
python -m repomix --remote https://github.com/username/repo
```

To initialize a new configuration file:

```bash
python -m repomix --init
```

### 4.2 Configuration Options

Create a `repomix.config.json` file in your project root for custom configurations:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "file_path": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown",
    "header_text": "",
    "instruction_file_path": "",
    "remove_comments": false,
    "remove_empty_lines": false,
    "top_files_length": 5,
    "show_line_numbers": false,
    "copy_to_clipboard": false,
    "include_empty_directories": false,
    "calculate_tokens": false,
    "show_file_stats": false,
    "show_directory_structure": true
  },
  "security": {
    "enable_security_check": true,
    "exclude_suspicious_files": true
  },
  "ignore": {
    "custom_patterns": [],
    "use_gitignore": true,
    "use_default_ignore": true
  },
  "include": []
}
```

**Command Line Options**

-   `-v, --version`: Show version
-   `-o, --output <file>`: Specify output file name
-   `--style <style>`: Specify output style (plain, xml, markdown)
-   `--remote <url>`: Process a remote Git repository
-   `--init`: Initialize configuration file
-   `--no-security-check`: Disable security check
-   `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging

### 4.3 Security Check

Repomix includes built-in security checks to detect potentially sensitive information in your files. This helps prevent accidental exposure of secrets when sharing your codebase.

The security check is powered by the [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) library, which can identify various types of secrets including:

- API keys
- AWS access keys
- Database credentials
- Private keys
- Authentication tokens
- And more...

You can disable security checks using:

```bash
python -m repomix --no-security-check
```

### 4.4 Ignore Patterns

Repomix provides multiple methods to set ignore patterns for excluding specific files or directories during the packing process:

#### Priority Order

Ignore patterns are applied in the following priority order (from highest to lowest):

1. Custom patterns in configuration file (`ignore.custom_patterns`)
2. `.repomixignore` file
3. `.gitignore` file (if `ignore.use_gitignore` is true)
4. Default patterns (if `ignore.use_default_ignore` is true)

#### Ignore Methods

##### .gitignore
By default, Repomix uses patterns listed in your project's `.gitignore` file. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.use_gitignore` option in the configuration file:

```json
{
  "ignore": {
    "use_gitignore": true
  }
}
```

##### Default Patterns
Repomix includes a default list of commonly excluded files and directories (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.git`, binary files). This feature can be controlled with the `ignore.use_default_ignore` option:

```json
{
  "ignore": {
    "use_default_ignore": true
  }
}
```

The complete list of default ignore patterns can be found in [default_ignore.py](src/repomix/config/default_ignore.py).

##### .repomixignore
You can create a `.repomixignore` file in your project root to define Repomix-specific ignore patterns. This file follows the same format as `.gitignore`.

##### Custom Patterns
Additional ignore patterns can be specified using the `ignore.custom_patterns` option in the configuration file:

```json
{
  "ignore": {
    "custom_patterns": [
      "*.log",
      "*.tmp",
      "tests/**/*.pyc"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Notes

- Binary files are not included in the packed output by default, but their paths are listed in the "Repository Structure" section of the output file. This provides a complete overview of the repository structure while keeping the packed file efficient and text-based.
- Ignore patterns help optimize the size of the generated pack file by ensuring the exclusion of security-sensitive files and large binary files, while preventing the leakage of confidential information.
- All ignore patterns use glob pattern syntax similar to `.gitignore`.

## 🔒 5. Output File Format

Repomix generates a single file with clear separators between different parts of your codebase. To enhance AI comprehension, the output file begins with an AI-oriented explanation, making it easier for AI models to understand the context and structure of the packed repository.

### 5.1 Plain Text Format (default)

```text
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

================================================================
File Summary
================================================================
(Metadata and usage AI instructions)

================================================================
Repository Structure
================================================================
src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.py
    index.py
  config/
    configLoader.py

(...remaining directories)

================================================================
Repository Files
================================================================

================
File: src/index.py
================
# File contents here

================
File: src/utils.py
================
# File contents here

(...remaining files)

================================================================
Statistics
================================================================
(File statistics and metadata)
```

### 5.2 Markdown Format

To generate output in Markdown format, use the `--style markdown` option:

```bash
python -m repomix --style markdown
```

The Markdown format structures the content in a readable manner:

`````markdown
# File Summary
(Metadata and usage AI instructions)

# Repository Structure
```
src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.py
    index.py
```

# Repository Files

## File: src/index.py
```python
# File contents here
```

## File: src/utils.py
```python
# File contents here
```

# Statistics
- Total Files: 19
- Total Characters: 37377
- Total Tokens: 11195
`````

### 5.3 XML Format

To generate output in XML format, use the `--style xml` option:

```bash
python -m repomix --style xml
```

The XML format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<repository>
<repository_structure>
(Directory and file structure)
</repository_structure>

<repository_files>
<file>
  <path>src/index.py</path>
  <stats>
    <chars>1234</chars>
    <tokens>567</tokens>
  </stats>
  <content>
    # File contents here
  </content>
</file>
(...remaining files)
</repository_files>

<statistics>
  <total_files>19</total_files>
  <total_chars>37377</total_chars>
  <total_tokens>11195</total_tokens>
</statistics>
</repository>
```
