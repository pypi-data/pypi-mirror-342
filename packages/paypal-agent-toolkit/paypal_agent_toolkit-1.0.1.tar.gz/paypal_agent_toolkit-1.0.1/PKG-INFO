## Prerequisites

Before setting up the workspace, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- A PayPal developer account for API credentials

## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just
want to use the package, just run:

```sh
pip install paypal-agent-toolkit
```

## Usage

The library needs to be configured with your PayPal developer account's API credentials which is
available in your [PayPal Developer Dashboard][app-keys].

```python
from paypal_agent_toolkit.openai.toolkit import PayPalToolkit
from paypal_agent_toolkit.common.configuration import Configuration, Context

configuration = Configuration(
    actions={
        "orders": {
            "create": True,
            "get": True,
            "capture": True,
        }
    },
    context=Context(
        sandbox=True
    )
)

# Initialize toolkit
toolkit = PayPalToolkit(client_id=PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID, secret=PAYPAL_SECRET, configuration = configuration)

```

This toolkit is designed to work with OpenAI's Agent SDK and Assistant API. It provides pre-built tools for managing PayPal transactions like creating, capturing, and checking orders details etc.


### Using with OpenAI Agent SDK
```python
from agents import Agent

tools = toolkit.get_tools()

agent = Agent(
    name="PayPal Assistant",
    instructions="""
    You're a helpful assistant specialized in managing PayPal transactions:
    - To create orders, invoke create_order.
    - After approval by user, invoke capture_order.
    - To check an order status, invoke get_order_status.
    """,
    tools=tools
)
```


### Using with OpenAI Assistants API
```python

tools = toolkit.get_openai_chat_tools()
paypal_api = toolkit.get_paypal_api()

# Create assistant
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    name="PayPal Checkout Assistant",
    instructions=f"""
You help users create and capture PayPal orders. When the user wants to make a purchase,
use the create_order tool and share the approval link. After approval, use capture_order.
""",
    model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
    tools=tools
)

# Create thread
thread = client.beta.threads.create()

# Start or retrieve a run
run = client.beta.threads.runs.retrieve(thread_id=thread.id, run_id=run.id)
```

Examples for OpenAI's Agent SDK are included in [/examples](/examples).
