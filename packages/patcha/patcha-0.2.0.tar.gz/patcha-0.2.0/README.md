# 🛡️ Patcha Engine

Patcha is an LLM-enhanced codebase scanner that seamlessly integrates with your AI Code Editor to provide comprehensive security analysis and vulnerability detection. Unlike traditional security tools, Patcha generates AI-friendly reports that your AI Code Editor can directly use to fix security issues. This means you can identify and resolve vulnerabilities effortlessly - no need to switch between tools or rely on base LLMs unfit for security. Simply run Patcha, add the generated `shield.json` as context to your AI Code Editor, and let it handle the security fixes while you focus on shipping your code with confidence.
