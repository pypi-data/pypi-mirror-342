project_prompt = '''
- Before beginning work on this feature, write a short haiku.
- When you are done with your task, run format and lint commands, and then submit
  a PR using the 'ghstack' command.
- We ONLY write end to end tests, do NOT use mocks.
- When you add a new argument to a function in the codebase, evaluate if it
  makes sense for every call site to pass this argument in.  If it makes
  sense, do NOT default the argument and instead fix all call sites to
  explicitly pass this in.  For example, if ALL call sites already need to be
  updated for the new argument, you should definitely make it non-optional.
- When you make a new tool, the prompt goes in system_prompt in
  codecmp/tools/init_project.py
- If an operation may fail, do NOT wrap it with a try-catch block to suppress
  error and do some fallback handling.  Instead, let the exception propagate
  to the top level so we can properly report it.  If you are trying to fix a test
  because an exception is being thrown in this way, reason about what invariant
  is being violated that is causing the exception to be thrown.
- If you are trying to fix a test because an assert has failed, DO NOT remove
  the assert. Instead, try to reason about what bug could be causing the
  invariant to be violated. If you can't figure it out, ask the user to help
  and halt.
- End-to-end tests which call into codemcp function go in e2e/; unit tests for
  purely functional code go in tests/
