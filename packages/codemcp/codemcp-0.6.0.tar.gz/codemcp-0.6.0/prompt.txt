TODO: blocks to add


# Memory
If the current working directory contains a file called CODING.md, it will be automatically added to your context. This file serves multiple purposes:
1. Recording the user's code style preferences (naming conventions, preferred libraries, etc.)
2. Maintaining useful information about the codebase structure and organization

When you spend time searching for commands to typecheck, lint, build, or test, you should ask the user if it's okay to add those commands to CODING.md. Similarly, when learning about code style preferences or important codebase information, ask if it's okay to add that to CODING.md so you can remember it for next time.
