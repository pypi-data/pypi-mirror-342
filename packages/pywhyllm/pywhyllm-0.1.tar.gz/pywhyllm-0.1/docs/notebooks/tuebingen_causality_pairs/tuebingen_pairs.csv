Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterised
by sudden occurrence of pains in the abdomen region and the urination in form of
constant urine pushing, micturition pains and sometimes lack of urine keeping.
Temperature of the body is rising, however most often not above 38C. The excreted
urine is turbid and sometimes bloody. At proper treatment, symptoms decay usually
within several days. However, there is inclination to returns. At persons with acute
inflammation of urinary bladder, we should expect that the illness will turn into
protracted form.

Acute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs considerably more often at women than at
men. It begins with sudden fever, which reaches, and sometimes exceeds 40C. The fever
is accompanied by shivers and one- or both-side lumbar pains, which are sometimes very
strong. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear very often. Quite not
infrequently there are nausea and vomiting and spread pains of whole abdomen.

The data was created by a medical expert as a data set to test the expert system, which
will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. 
Each instance represents an potential patient. 

Discrete and logical data:
1 = yes, 2 = no

X is 6-dimensional
1 	Temperature of patient { 35C-42C } 
2 	Occurrence of nausea 
3 	Lumbar pain
4 	Urine pushing (continuous need for urination)
5 	Micturition pains
6 	Burning of urethra, itch, swelling of urethra outlet

Y is 2-dimensional
7	decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder
8 	decision: Nephritis of renal pelvis origin 


","The 6-dimensional symptoms in this context refer to the six key indicators used in the data set to diagnose urinary system diseases, namely: patient's temperature, occurrence of nausea, lumbar pain, continuous need for urination (urine pushing), micturition pains, and burning, itching, or swelling of the urethra outlet.","The concept of Classification of disease (2-dim.) in this context refers to the process of categorizing potential patients into two specific urinary system diseases, namely Inflammation of urinary bladder and Nephritis of renal pelvis origin, based on a set of six symptoms and conditions."

pair0085, Time of measurement, Protein content of milk, R,1,0,"Description of pair0085:

This data set is extracted from that for the milk protein trial used by Verbyla and Cullis (1990).  The original data set consists of assayed protein content of milk samples taken weekly from each of 79 cows.  The cows were randomly allocated to one of three diets: barley, mixed barley-lupins, and lupins, with 25, 27, and 27 cows in the three groups, respectively.  Measurements were taken for up to 19 weeks, but there were 38 drop-outs from week 15 onwards, corresponding to cows who stopped producing milk before the end of the experiment.

We removed the missing values (drop-outs) in the data set: we did not consider the measurements from week 15 onwards, which contain many drop-outs, and we discarded the cows with drop-outs before week 15.  Finally, the data set contains 71 cows and 14 weeks.  Furthermore, we re-organized the data set to see the relationship between the milk protein and the time to take the measurement:

X : time to take weekly measurements (from 1 to 14).

Y : protein content of the milk produced by each cow at time X.


Group truth: 

X -> Y.


Remark:

Here we do not consider the effect of the diets on the protein content.  Note that rigorously speaking, X, together with the diets, causes Y.

The original data set is available at
