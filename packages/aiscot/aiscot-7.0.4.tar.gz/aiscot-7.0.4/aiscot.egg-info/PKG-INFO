# Display Ships in TAK - AIS to TAK Gateway 

AISCOT is a software solution designed to monitor and analyze maritime surveillance data within the Team Awareness KIT (TAK) suite. It captures and reports real-time Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from vessels and other maritime objects into TAK products using native TAK protocols, including Cursor on Target (CoT).

## Features

- Real-time AIS data capture and reporting
- Integration with TAK products using native protocols
- Compatibility with ATAK, WinTAK, iTAK, TAK Server & TAKX
- Support for RF AIS transmissions, local NMEA, and Internet AIS aggregators
- Display of AIS data with icons, attitude, type, track, bearing, speed, callsign, and more
- Support for [United States Department of Transportation (US DOT) SeaVision](https://seavision.volpe.dot.gov/)
