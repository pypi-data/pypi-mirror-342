# SmartCal – Auto-Calibration for Machine Learning

**SmartCal** is a modular and extensible Python package that provides automated, metric-driven calibration of classification models. It leverages meta-learning to recommend and tune the best calibrator from a rich suite of calibration algorithms. SmartCal supports evaluation with popular calibration metrics.

## Features

### 1. SmartCal Engine
- 🔍 **Meta-learning-powered recommendation** of calibration methods based on dataset characteristics.
- Automated **hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian Optimization**.
- Provides a unified interface for fitting and applying the best calibrator using:
    ```python
    from smartcal import SmartCal

    # Initialize SmartCal
    smartcal = SmartCal(metric='ECE') # Now, ECE only and other metrics will be provided in the future.

    # Step 1: Get top 3 recommended calibration methods
    recommended = smartcal.recommend_calibrators(y_true, predictions_prob, n=3) 

    # Step 2: Fit and retrieve the best calibrator
    best_calibrator = smartcal.best_fitted_calibrator(y_true, predictions_prob, n_iter=20)

    # Step 3: Use the calibrator
    calibrated_probs = best_calibrator.predict(predictions_prob)
    ```
- Note: The maximum number of supported calibrators is 12, not 13. This is because we do not include the Probability Tree Calibrator in the default meta-calibration pipeline, as it operates differently by incorporating data features in addition to model outputs. However, you can still use it independently via the calibration_algorithms module.

### 2. Calibration Algorithms
- Supports **diverse calibration methods**, including:
  - Parametric: Temperature Scaling, Platt, Vector, Matrix, Beta, Dirichlet, Adaptive TS
  - Non-parametric: Isotonic, Histogram, Empirical Binning
  - Hybrid: Meta Calibration, Mix-and-Match Calibration
- Each calibrator implements standard `.fit()` and `.predict() and metadata` APIs.

### 3. Calibration Metrics
- Built-in evaluation metrics to assess calibration quality:
  - **ECE** – Expected Calibration Error
  - **MCE** – Maximum Calibration Error
  - **ConfECE** – Confidence-Binned ECE
  - **Brier Score**
  - **Calibration Curves** – for visual inspection of reliability
