# This is an example of how to setup Prefect settings for a cloud agent. In this
# example, we want Prefect agent that submits jobs to a Dask cluster that submits 
# jobs through SLURM. Note, the job settings for the Dask cluster (and also 
# the SLURM jobs) are set in the `dask_cluster.yaml` file.
# 
# Note, make sure you have properly configured Prefect to connect to cloud.
#
# For more information, see Prefect's guides:
# https://docs.prefect.io/orchestration/
# https://docs.prefect.io/orchestration/agents/overview.html

# A general name that will show up in Prefect Cloud. This can be anything. Here
# we use the name of the Warren Lab's HPC cluster
agent_name: WarWulf

# Labels that this cluster should pick up from cloud. Remove this if you
# want the agent to grab all non-labeled workflows.
agent_labels: [DESKTOP-PVN50G5, digital-storm]

# The type of cluster your want workers submitted through. See the
# `dask_cluster.yaml` file for more information.
dask_cluster_type: SLURM
