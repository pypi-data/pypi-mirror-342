    `base_url` with the given `query_params_dict` encoded. When signup or login
    finishes, Hashboard's app server creates a new access key for the user (as
    well as an account and project if the user is signing up).

    To receive information back from this browser page about the newly created
    access key (and potentially account and project), this function spins up a
    local HTTP server that listens for GET requests. In addition to the
    `query_params_dict` passed to this function, we also append a
    `cli-auth-server-host` param specifying a redirect URL at the server that
    this function spins up. Hashboard's app server makes a GET request to this URL
    using query params to pass information about the created access key back to the
    CLI client. `handle_get_query_params` is a callback that consumes the received
    query params as a dictionary and returns a final redirect URL to send the user's
    browser page to.

    Args:
        handle_get_query_params (QueryParamsHandler): Callback that consumes query params dict and returns a redirect URL.
        base_url (str): Base URL to send the user to that should enable either signup or login.
        query_params_dict (dict): Dict of query params to append to `base_url`. This function internally handles adding
          the `cli-auth-server-host` param, so consumers need not worry about this.
