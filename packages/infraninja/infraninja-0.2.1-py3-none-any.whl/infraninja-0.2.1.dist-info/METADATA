# 🥷 InfraNinja ⚡ – Your Stealthy PyInfra Deployments 📦

Welcome to **InfraNinja**! 🎉 This project contains a set of common PyInfra deployments 🥷 used by all teams at Kalvad 🛠️, making them publicly available for everyone via PyPi! 🚀

These ninja-level deployments are designed to simplify infrastructure management and automate common tasks, helping you set up services like **Netdata**, configure security, and more – fast and effortlessly! 💨

## ⚡️ Features

- 🌐 **Automated Deployments**: Easily deploy services like **Netdata**, NGINX, Docker, and more with ninja-like precision! 🥷
- 🛡️ **Security Focused**: Set up firewalls, harden SSH, and safeguard your servers like a true ninja.
- 🧩 **Modular**: Reusable deployment modules that you can drop into any project.
- 🛠️ **Configurable**: Fine-tune your deployments with flexible templates and configuration files.
- 📦 **PyPi Support**: Available publicly on PyPi for smooth, easy installation in your environments.

## 🎯 Getting Started

To get started with **InfraNinja**, you can install it directly from PyPi:

```bash
pip install infraninja
```

Then, bring ninja-style automation to your infrastructure with simple imports:

```python
from infraninja.netdata import deploy_netdata
```

## 🚀 Example Usage

Here’s how you can deploy **Netdata** like a ninja 🥷:

```python
from infraninja.netdata import deploy_netdata

deploy_netdata()
```

Or, configure **Netdata** settings with precision:

```python
from infraninja.netdata import configure_netdata

configure_netdata()
```
