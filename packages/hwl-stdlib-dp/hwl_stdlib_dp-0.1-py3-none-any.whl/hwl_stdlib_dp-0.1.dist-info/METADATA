# stdlib

A standard library used by me frequently. A gift from me, to me, by me. üéÅ

`stdlib` is my personal collection of Python functions, utilities, and snippets that I frequently use in my projects. Whether it's for automating repetitive tasks, streamlining common processes, or making coding life just a bit easier, `stdlib` has got me covered. Built with love and laziness, this library helps me avoid reinventing the wheel.

## Features

- **Handpicked Utilities**: A carefully curated set of functions to make my daily coding workflow smoother.
- **Well-documented**: Each function is self-documented to ensure I can remember what it does‚Äîbecause, honestly, I won‚Äôt always remember.
- **Custom-Built**: Built with my own needs in mind, this package helps me save time by providing ready-made solutions to common coding problems.
- **Minimalistic**: No bloat. Just the essentials.

## Installation

You can install `stdlib` directly from your local repository:

```bash
pip install .
