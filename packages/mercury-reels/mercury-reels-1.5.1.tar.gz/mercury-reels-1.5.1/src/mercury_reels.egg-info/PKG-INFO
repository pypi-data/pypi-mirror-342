              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## What is this?

### TLDR: Reels helps identify patterns in event data and can predict target events.

**Reels** is a library to analyze sequences of events extracted from transactional data. These events can be automatically discovered
or manually defined. **Reels** identifies events by assigning them **event codes** and creates **clips**, which are sequences of
**(code, time of occurrence)** tuples for each **client**. Using these clips, a model can be generated to predict the time at which
**target events** may occur in the future.

### What problems is REELS good for?

Reels was born to analyze web navigation transactional data. It has natural applications in cybersecurity and everywhere where predicting
**events** or scoring **risk of events** based on past events makes sense. The definition of **relevant event** may be discovered from
transactional data or is established as business domain knowledge. It can also be semi-automated using Reels event optimizer to iterate
and learn how events predict a target.

### What data size can reels tackle?

Reels is a C++ implementation with a Python interface. It is single threaded and can seamlessly operate over millions of clients and
billions of records with hundreds of thousands of events. To further parallelize, it can partition the data by dividing the set of
clients into smaller subsets and operate on each subset independently.

### I already have time series and sequence prediction tools, why would I need another one?

  * Reels is oriented towards **events** (as opposed to continuous variables like a price).
  * Even when your problem is better seen as time series, Reels predictions can be used as features to boost another model.
  * Supports manual, full automatic or assisted definition of what relevant (predictive) events are.
  * Predicts a target event within or outside the transactional dataset.
  * Highly efficient C++ implementation.
  * 100% pythonic interface: objects are serializable, use iterators, interfaces with pandas and pyspark.

## The Python API

Reels is implemented in four classes.

## Try it without any installation on Google Colab

  * **Introductory**: A walk through Reels [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BBVA/mercury-reels/blob/master/notebooks/reels_walkthrough_colab.ipynb)
  * **Advanced**: Event optimization -- How to do assisted event discovery [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BBVA/mercury-reels/blob/master/notebooks/reels_event_optimization_colab.ipynb)

## Install

```bash
pip install mercury-reels
```

## Clone and set up a development environment to work with it

To work with Reels command line or develop Reels, you can set up an environment with git, gcc, make and the following tools:

  * catch2 (Already included in source code)
  * doxygen 1.9.5 or better (to render C++ documentation)
  * mkdocs 1.4.2 or better (to render Python documentation)
  * swig 4.0.2
  * python 3.x with appropriate paths to python.h (see Makefile)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BBVA/mercury-reels.git
cd mercury-reels/src

make
```

Make without arguments gives help. Try all the options. Everything should work assuming the tools are installed.
