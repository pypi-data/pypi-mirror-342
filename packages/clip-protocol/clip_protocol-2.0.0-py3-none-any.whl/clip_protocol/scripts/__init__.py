"""
This subpackage contains utility scripts for data preprocessing and parameter fitting.
These scripts are designed to support the main functionality of the Local_Privacy package
by providing tools for preparing data and tuning algorithm parameters.

Modules:
- preprocess.py: Contains routines for preprocessing raw data before applying privacy algorithms.
- parameter_fitting.py: Implements methods for tuning parameters to optimize the balance between privacy and utility.
