Implementation of a Cyclic Swarm Pattern for Red Team Operations

This module establishes a coordinated multi-agent system where specialized agents
collaborate on security assessment tasks. The pattern implements a directed graph
of agent relationships, where each agent can transfer context (message history) 
to another agent through handoff functions, creating a complete communication network
for comprehensive security analysis.
