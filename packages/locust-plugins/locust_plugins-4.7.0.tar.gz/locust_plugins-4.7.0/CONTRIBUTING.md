Contributing Guidelines
=======================

If you want to talk about a contribution before you start writing code & making a pull request, please [file an issue](https://github.com/SvenskaSpel/locust-plugins/issues/new). You can also find me (cyberwiz) semi-regularly on the official locust [slack](https://locustio.slack.com) [(signup)](https://communityinviter.com/apps/locustio/locust)

In order to maintain a good level of quality, please ensure that your code:

* Is formatted using black (https://github.com/psf/black)

* Passes linting with pylint (https://www.pylint.org/)

* Has relevant examples [here](examples/)
