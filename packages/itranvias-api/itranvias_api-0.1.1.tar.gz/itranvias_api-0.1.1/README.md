Python API wrapper for the city of A Coru√±a public transport ran by *Cia. Tranv√≠as de La Coru√±a, S.A.*.

## üìú Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://peprolinbot.github.io/itranvias_api). 

For the time being there is only one submodule: `itranvias_api.queryitr` which implements all (that I know of) functionality in the [official iTranv√≠as client](https://itranvias.com/), using the "queryitr" API used by it, found at `https://itranvias.com/queryitr_v3.php`.

## üîß Installation

Just run:

``` bash
pip install itranvias_api
```

## üñ•Ô∏è CLI client

I have written a very simple, very basic POC, CLI client using this library, it is avaliable as `itranvias-cli` once the package is installed.

### Usage:
```
usage: itranvias-cli [-h] {stop,line} ...

Get real-time bus information for the city of A Coru√±a.

positional arguments:
  {stop,line}
    stop       Get next buses for a specific stop.
    line       Get buses and stops 'diagram' for a specific line and route.

options:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
```
