        Test that verifies the fix for the duplicate constraint detection issue.

        This test confirms that the issue where Django's migration system was detecting changes
        to the User model that were already reflected in a migration file has been fixed.

        Background:
        - django-solomon adds a unique constraint to the User model's email field via a migration file
          (0003_add_unique_constraint_auth_user_email.py)

        - Previously, the constraint was also being added at runtime in the AppConfig.ready() method,
          which caused Django's migration system to detect changes that were already reflected
          in a migration file, leading to unnecessary migration files being created.

        - This test verifies that the issue has been fixed by checking that Django no longer detects
          a need to remove and then re-add the unique_user_email constraint on the User model.
