# Safeguards Component Status

This document provides the current status of each component in the Safeguards framework, indicating which are ready for production use and which are still in development.

## Production-Ready Components

These components have been thoroughly tested and are ready for production use:

### Core Components

- **BudgetCoordinator** (`safeguards.core.BudgetCoordinator`)
  - Manages agent budgets and budget pools
  - Provides budget tracking and alerts
  - Example: `examples/single_agent.py`, `examples/budget_control_example.py`

- **NotificationManager** (`safeguards.notifications.NotificationManager`)
  - Handles alerts across different channels (console, email, Slack, etc.)
  - Configurable notification levels and cooldown periods
  - Example: `examples/notification_setup.py`

- **ViolationReporter** (`safeguards.violations.ViolationReporter`)
  - Reports and tracks safety violations
  - Supports different violation types and severity levels
  - Example: `examples/single_agent.py`

- **MetricsAnalyzer** (`safeguards.monitoring.metrics.MetricsAnalyzer`)
  - Collects and analyzes usage metrics
  - Provides insights on resource usage and budget consumption
  - Example: `examples/budget_monitoring.py`

### Guardrails

- **BudgetGuardrail** (`safeguards.guardrails.BudgetGuardrail`)
  - Enforces budget limits and prevents overspending
  - Example: `examples/guardrails_example.py`

- **ResourceGuardrail** (`safeguards.guardrails.ResourceGuardrail`)
  - Monitors and limits resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.)
  - Example: `examples/guardrails_example.py`

## Components in Development

These components are still under development and should be used with caution or avoided in production:

### Swarm Management (Experimental)

- **SwarmController** (`safeguards.swarm.SwarmController`)
  - Status: **EXPERIMENTAL**
  - Intended for coordinating multiple agents with safety controls
  - Current limitations:
    - API is not finalized
    - Missing key functionality (get_agent_guardrails, run_agent)
    - Not correctly integrated with budget pools
  - Recommended alternative: Use BudgetCoordinator directly as shown in `examples/multi_agent.py`

- **SwarmConfig** (`safeguards.swarm.SwarmConfig`)
  - Status: **EXPERIMENTAL**
  - Configuration for SwarmController
  - Will be revised with final SwarmController implementation

## Usage Recommendations

1. **For Production Systems:**
   - Stick to the production-ready components listed above
   - Avoid using experimental components without thorough testing
   - Use the examples as a guide for proper integration

2. **For Development/Testing:**
   - You can experiment with all components
   - Provide feedback on experimental components to help improve them
   - Contribute tests and documentation for components you use

3. **For Contributing:**
   - Focus on improving the experimental components
   - Add tests for edge cases in production-ready components
   - Improve documentation and examples

## Future Roadmap

The following improvements are planned for future releases:

1. Complete implementation of SwarmController for multi-agent coordination
2. Enhanced pool management with better metrics and visualization
3. Improved integration with various agent frameworks
4. Additional guardrails for content safety and security
5. Advanced analytics and reporting features

Please check the GitHub repository for the latest updates and progress on these features.
