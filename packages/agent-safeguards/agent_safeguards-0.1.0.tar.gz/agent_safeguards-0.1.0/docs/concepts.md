# Core Concepts

This document explains the core concepts and terminology used throughout the Safeguards.

## Overview

The Safeguards is built around several key concepts:

1. **Agents** - The entities that perform tasks
2. **Budgets** - Resource constraints for agent operations
3. **Pools** - Shared resource containers
4. **Coordination** - Management of resources across agents
5. **Monitoring** - Observation of system metrics
6. **Guardrails** - Safety mechanisms that prevent harmful actions
7. **Notifications** - Alerts and messages about system status

## Agents

An agent in this framework represents an autonomous entity that performs tasks and consumes resources. The `Agent` class is the base abstraction for all agent implementations.

Key characteristics of agents:
- **Identity**: Each agent has a unique identifier
- **Budget**: Agents consume budget when performing actions
- **Priority**: Agents can have different priority levels (1-10)
- **State**: Agents maintain state between operations

Agents are registered with the system and their resource usage is tracked throughout their lifecycle.

## Budgets

Budgets represent the resources available to agents. These are typically numerical values (e.g., tokens, API calls, compute time) that are consumed when agents perform actions.

Key characteristics of budgets:
- **Initial Allocation**: Starting amount of resources
- **Usage Tracking**: System tracks consumption over time
- **Limits**: Configurable thresholds (hourly, daily, total)
- **Warnings**: Alerts when approaching limits

## Budget Pools

Budget pools are containers that hold shared resources that can be distributed among multiple agents. Pools allow for more efficient resource allocation and sharing.

Key characteristics of pools:
- **Total Budget**: Overall resources available in the pool
- **Allocated Budget**: Resources currently assigned to agents
- **Priority**: Pools have priority levels for resource contention
- **Minimum Balance**: Required minimum resources to maintain

## Budget Coordination

Budget coordination is the process of managing resource allocation, transfers, and rebalancing across agents and pools.

Key capabilities:
- **Registration**: Adding agents and pools to the system
- **Transfer**: Moving resources between agents or pools
- **Allocation**: Distributing resources based on priorities
- **Rebalancing**: Dynamically adjusting allocations based on usage patterns
- **Emergency Handling**: Special procedures for critical operations

## Monitoring

Monitoring involves tracking system metrics, agent behavior, and resource usage to ensure safe operation.

Key monitoring aspects:
- **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Agent Metrics**: Budget usage, action counts, latency
- **System Metrics**: Overall usage, error rates, health status
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend detection and pattern recognition

## Safety Guardrails

Guardrails are protective mechanisms that prevent unsafe operations. They typically implement validation logic that runs before agent actions.

Types of guardrails:
- **Budget Guardrails**: Prevent budget overruns
- **Resource Guardrails**: Prevent excessive resource consumption
- **Permission Guardrails**: Enforce access controls
- **Content Guardrails**: Validate inputs and outputs for safety
- **Rate Guardrails**: Prevent too many operations in a time window

## Notifications & Alerts

The notification system provides visibility into system events, warnings, and errors.

Key elements:
- **Alert Levels**: Different severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- **Channels**: Different notification methods (console, email, webhook)
- **Targeting**: Specific notifications for specific components or agents
- **Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for generating alerts

## APIs & Contracts

The framework uses API contracts to define consistent interfaces across different versions.

Key API categories:
- **Agent API**: For agent management
- **Budget API**: For budget operations
- **Metrics API**: For monitoring and metrics
- **Config API**: For system configuration
- **Notification API**: For alerts and notifications

## Transactions

The framework uses a transaction system to ensure operations that span multiple resources remain consistent.

Key aspects:
- **Atomicity**: Operations succeed completely or fail completely
- **Consistency**: System remains in a valid state
- **Isolation**: Concurrent operations don't interfere
- **Durability**: Completed operations persist

## Priority Levels

Priority determines the importance of agents, pools, and operations, influencing resource allocation.

Priority levels range from 1-10:
- **1-2**: Low priority (background tasks)
- **3-5**: Normal priority (standard operations)
- **6-8**: High priority (important services)
- **9-10**: Critical priority (essential services)

## Violation Types

When safety rules are broken, the system generates violation reports with specific types:

- **Overspend**: Budget exceeded allocated amount
- **Rate Limit**: Too many operations in a time window
- **Resource Breach**: Exceeded resource allocation
- **Unauthorized**: Attempted operation without permission
- **Pool Breach**: Pool resources depleted below minimum
