## Auth Implementation Notes

Since Safeguards is a library rather than a service, authentication and authorization should be implemented as:

1. **Pluggable Interfaces**: Provide interfaces that allow host applications to inject their authentication and authorization systems.

2. **Authorization Hooks**: Add hooks at critical points (budget modifications, rule changes, etc.) that host applications can use to enforce authorization policies.

3. **Tenant Isolation**: Support multi-tenant environments by ensuring resources (budgets, agents, rules) are properly isolated by tenant.

4. **Audit Trail**: Provide ways to log who performed what actions, but let the host application define the "who".

5. **Reference Implementations**: Include optional implementations for common auth patterns that applications can use, but don't enforce any specific auth mechanism.

6. **Documentation**: Provide clear guidance on how to securely integrate the library with existing auth systems.

The goal is to enable security without dictating the authentication mechanism, allowing the library to integrate with existing enterprise auth systems.
