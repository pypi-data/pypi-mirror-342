"""This is a simple script to collect dataset on robot's execution of actions.

The actions are recorded with a frequency specified when the robot's moving.
This dataset can be used to train a robotic transformer model directly.

Usage:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
    python examples/5_teach_robot_record_dataset.py --task "pick up the remote" --backend "openai"
