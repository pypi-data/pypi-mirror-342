**pytraceability** is a Python library that helps you link code to requirements.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still a work in flux. Although the core functionality is largely there,
> the API is not stable and some parts will definitely change in the future.

It provides a command line interface (CLI) and a Python API for tracing the relationships
between code and requirements. It also tracks the history of the implementation through git.

It defines a decorator that can be used to annotate functions, classes, and methods with traceability information,
linking back to requirements and other relevant documentation.
