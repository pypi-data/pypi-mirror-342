# cv2

**⚠️ This package is not the real OpenCV!**

This is a simulated `cv2` module for **security awareness and demonstration purposes only**. It mimics OpenCV's API but triggers alerts to educate users about **typosquatting and PyPI supply chain risks**.

## Purpose

- Raise awareness on malicious `pip install` behavior.
- Showcase common hijack techniques used in fake libraries.
- Train developers to verify package origins.

**Note**: If you’re looking for the real computer vision library, install:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
