# ThereIsPythonLibraryForThis ðŸ¤¡

Youâ€™ve got a problem? Donâ€™t worry, thereâ€™s a Python library for that. Probably. 

## What is this?

A Python library that finds other Python libraries for you. Because, clearly, you couldnâ€™t be bothered to do it yourself. I mean, why *think* when you can just **install**? Itâ€™s like magic, but without the charm.

## Features

- **It finds libraries.** Thatâ€™s literally it. You give it some words, and it spits out libraries. Nothing fancy.
- **Sarcasm included.** You asked for it, so Iâ€™m giving it. Youâ€™ll love it or hate it. Either way, I donâ€™t care.
- **Scrapes PyPI** so you donâ€™t have to. Seriously, you *donâ€™t* want to search PyPI. Itâ€™s a nightmare.

## Installation

```bash
pip install thereispythonlibraryforthis
