Use this module to plan a phone calls schedule for your partners,
assuming you have specified the ideal time to call them.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To use this module, you need to specify your partners' preferred phone
call schedule:

1. Go to any partner's form > *Phone Calls*.
2. Set the preferred phone calling schedule for the partner.
3. Repeat above steps for all of your partners.

Usage
=====

Now, to actually generate the phone call planning:

1. Go to *CRM > Phone Calls > Planner*.
2. Fill the fields under *Call details*. Those fields will be saved
   literally in the generated phone calls.
3. Fill the fields under *Criteria*. Those fields are used to filter the
   partners and the preexisting calls. The UTM fields will also be saved
   literally in the generated phone calls.
4. Fill the fields under *Times*. See note below.
5. Fill the fields under *Repetition*. See note below.
6. Press *Generate planning*.
7. Wait a little bit (this is usually a long process).
8. You will get to the list of planned phone calls. Start calling!

Note about *Times* section
--------------------------

The *Start* and *End* times behave in a special way:

- Their *date* part is used to know the start and end dates for the
  planning.
- Their *time* part is used to know the time at which we will plan calls
  *each day under the date range*.

The *Call duration* field indicates the time spacing you want to leave
between one call and the next one.

So, for instance, if you select start on *2017-09-01 09:00:00*, end on
*2017-09-03 10:00:00* and duration of *1:00*, it will try to generate
these phone calls:

- 2017-09-01 09:00:00
- 2017-09-01 10:00:00
- 2017-09-02 09:00:00
- 2017-09-02 10:00:00
- 2017-09-03 09:00:00
- 2017-09-03 10:00:00

Note about *Repetition* section
-------------------------------

If you choose not to repeat calls, the planner will try to schedule one
single phone call for each **criteria combination** (*Partner + Campaign
+ Source + Medium*) under the specified conditions in the *Times*
section (see note above).

If you choose instead to repeat calls after some amount of days (*Days
gap*), the planner will:

1. Try to find a partner that matches the **criteria combination** and
   has never been called; then schedule a call for him.
2. If all matching partners have already been called, then search for
   matching partners that have not been called in the specified *Days
   gap*; then schedule a call for the one with least total scheduled
   calls.
3. If there is still no match, then schedule nothing and continue.
