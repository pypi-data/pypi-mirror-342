# collections-cache üöÄ

`collections-cache` is a fast and scalable key‚Äìvalue caching solution built on top of SQLite. It allows you to store, update, and retrieve data using unique keys, and it supports complex Python data types (thanks to `pickle`). Designed to harness the power of multiple CPU cores, the library shards data across multiple SQLite databases, enabling impressive performance scaling.

---

## Features ‚ú®

- **Multiple SQLite Databases**: Distributes your data across several databases to optimize I/O and take advantage of multi-core systems.
- **Key‚ÄìValue Store**: Simple and intuitive interface for storing and retrieving data.
- **Supports Complex Data Types**: Serialize and store lists, dictionaries, objects, and more using `pickle`.
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses Python‚Äôs `multiprocessing` and `concurrent.futures` modules to perform operations in parallel.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Caches all keys in memory for super-fast lookups.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Performance Scaling**: Benchmarks show near-linear scaling with the number of real CPU cores.

## Installation üì¶

Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install and manage dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Luiz-Trindade/collections_cache.git
    cd collections-cache
    ```

2. Install the package with Poetry:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

Simply import and start using the main class, `Collection_Cache`, to interact with your collection:

### Basic Example

```python
from collections_cache import Collection_Cache

# Create a new collection named "STORE"
cache = Collection_Cache("STORE")

# Set a key-value pair
cache.set_key("products", ["apple", "orange", "onion"])

# Retrieve the value by key
products = cache.get_key("products")
print(products)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'onion']
```

### Bulk Insertion Example

For faster insertions, accumulate your data and use `set_multi_keys`:

```python
from collections_cache import Collection_Cache
from random import uniform, randint
from time import time

cache = Collection_Cache("web_cache")
insertions = 100_000
data = {}

# Generate data
for i in range(insertions):
    key = str(uniform(0.0, 100.0))
    value = "some text :)" * randint(1, 100)
    data[key] = value

# Bulk insert keys using multi-threaded execution
cache.set_multi_keys(data)

print(f"Inserted {len(cache.keys())} keys successfully!")
```

## Performance Benchmark üìä

After optimizing SQLite settings (including setting `synchronous = OFF`), the library has shown a significant performance improvement. The insertion performance has been accelerated dramatically, allowing for much faster data insertions and better scalability.

### Benchmark Results

For **100,000 insertions**:

- **Previous performance**: ~797 insertions per second.
- **Optimized performance**: **~6,657 insertions per second** after disabling SQLite's synchronization (`synchronous = OFF`), reducing the total insertion time from 125 seconds to **15.02 seconds**.

### Performance Scaling

With the optimized configuration, the library scales nearly linearly with the number of CPU cores. For example:

- **4 cores**: ~6,657 insertions per second.
- **8 cores**: ~13,300 insertions per second.
- **16 cores**: ~26,600 insertions per second.
- **32 cores**: ~53,200 insertions per second.
- **128 cores**: ~212,000 insertions per second (theoretically).

*Note: Actual performance may vary depending on system architecture, disk I/O, and specific workload, but benchmarks indicate a substantial increase in insertion rate as the number of CPU cores increases.*

## API Overview üìö

- **`set_key(key, value)`**: Stores a key‚Äìvalue pair. Updates the value if the key already exists.
- **`set_multi_keys(key_and_value)`**: (Experimental) Inserts multiple key‚Äìvalue pairs in parallel.
- **`get_key(key)`**: Retrieves the value associated with a given key.
- **`delete_key(key)`**: Removes a key and its corresponding value.
- **`keys()`**: Returns a list of all stored keys.
- **`export_to_json()`**: (Future feature) Exports your collection to a JSON file.
