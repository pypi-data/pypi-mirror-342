# Setup parameters

-   Description: This file defines the input to a standard SEALS run. The markdown notation here is parsed to a csv file saved at scenario_definitions.csv. This file is then used to generate the SEALS model run. If you have just installed SEALS, be sure to run the "run_test_standard.py" file to generate an example of the CSV for you to inspect, edit, or use as a template.

## aoi

-   Description: Sets the area of interest. If set as a region_label (e.g., a country-ISO3 codes), all data will be generated based that regions boundaries (as defined in the regional_boundaries_input_path). Other options include setting it to "global" or a specific shapefile, or iso3 code. Good small examples include RWA, BTN. Can be either 3-letter ISO code, keyword "global", or is a path.
-   Type: string, path
-   Default: "RWA"
-   Required: True
-   Examples: "RWA", "BDI", "global", "cartographic/ee/seals/default_inputs/rwa_bdi.shp"

## regional_boundaries_input_path

-   Description: Path to the vector file of the regions present. This should be a geopackage (gpkg) file with a set of polygons paired with a unique region_label. This label should be defined in some regional correspondence file, ideally in the ee_r264_correspondence or the eemarine_r566_correspondence in the base_data. If regional projections are used, the region_labels must correspond to those defined in regional_projections_input_path.
-   Type: path
-   Default: "cartographic/ee/ee_r264_correspondence.gpkg"
-   Required: True
-   Examples: "cartographic/ee/ee_r264_correspondence.gpkg", "cartographic/ee/eemarine_r566_correspondence.gpkg"

## calibration_parameters_source

-   Description: Path to a csv which contains all of the pretrained regressor variables. Can also be "from_calibration" indicating that this run will actually create the calibration\`\` or it can be from a tile-designated file of location-specific regressor variables.
-   Type: path
-   Default: "seals/default_inputs/default_global_coefficients.csv"
-   Required: True
-   Examples: "seals/default_inputs/default_global_coefficients.csv", "from_calibration", "tile_designated"

## base_year_lulc_path

-   Description: Path to the base year LULC data. This is the data that will be used to determine the resolution, extent, and projection of the fine resolution LULC data.
-   Type: path
-   Default: "seals/default_inputs/esa_2017.tif"
-   Required: True
-   Examples: "seals/default_inputs/esa_2017.tif", "seals/default_inputs/esa_1992.tif", "seals/default_inputs/esa_2020\_.tif"

# Projection inputs

-   Description: SEALS supports 2 types of projection inputs: regional and coarse. Regional projections, defined via a vector file (gpkg) and some distribution algorithm (e.g. proportional allocation).Coarse are coarse-resolution gridded data, such as the 30km resolution outputs of IAMs.

## regional_projections_input_path

-   Description: Path to the regional land-use change data. This should be a table (csv) file with a region_label corresponding to a polygon in regional_boundaries_input_path. In this table, changes are reported in hectarage values for each region_label for each of the changing_lulc_classes.
    -   This is not required, but if it is not provided, the coarse projections must be a raster path or raster-producing task. This is because the other coarse input option is an integer resolution for the proportional allocation of the regional projections on the coarse grid of the integer's resolution (See below).
-   Type: path
-   Default: "cartographic/ee/seals/default_inputs/rwa_bdi_regional_changes.csv"
-   Required: False
-   Examples: "cartographic/ee/seals/default_inputs/rwa_bdi_regional_changes.csv"

## coarse_projections_input_path

-   Description: Designates how to handle the coarse land-use change projections. The coarse projections are always gridded, but are much coarser than the output LULC's fine resolution. Can be a path to a coarse-gridded set of rasters for each land-use change and time, can be an integer indicating the resolution of the coarse projection (but assuming a simple smooth proportional allocation of the regional projections to the coarse projections), or can be a string indicating the name of a task in the ProjectFlow object that will generate the coarse projections.
    -   If pointing to a raster, it should be (referred) a directory of geotiffs where directories follow the scenario_structure devined in exogeonous_label, climate_label, model_label, counterfactual_label, and years. The other type is a single netcdf file that contains all of the data. If it is a netcdf, you may optionally use the time_dim_adjustment parameter to adjust the time dimension to match the desired format.
        -   If it is a path, it should ideally be a ref_path (meaning that it is included in the base_data and is relative to the base_data_dir and can be found via p.get_path())
    -   If it is an integer, it should express a pyramid-compatible integer of arcsecond resolution, specifically 10, 30, 150, 300, 900, 1800, 3600, 7200, 14400, 36000 (though anything less than 300 might be weirdly small)
    -   If is a task, it must be an algorithm that produces a directory of geotiffs, as discussed above
-   Type: path, Integer, task_name
-   Default: "luh2/raw_data/rcp45_ssp2/multiple-states_input4MIPs_landState_ScenarioMIP_UofMD-MESSAGE-ssp245-2-1-f_gn_2015-2100.nc"

# Scenario structure

-   Description: Scenarios will follow the relatively strict structure defined below.

-   Default: None
-   Required: True

## base_years

-   Description: Which year in the observed data constitutes the base year. There may be multiple if, for instance, you want to use seals to downscale model outputs that update a base year to a more recent year base year which would now be based on model results but is for an existing year.

# Correspondneces

-   Description: There are two different correspondences that are typically used to map inputs to that required by seals. First is an LULC correspondence that maps the input, e.g., ESA CCI 37 classes, to some simpler classification for which there exists a SEALS calibration file, e.g., seals7. The second is the coarse-gridded land-use projection that maps the input, e.g., LUH2-14, to some simpler classification for which there exists a SEALS calibration file, e.g., seals7.

-   Note: Becasue this is a correspondence file, it should either have columns for at least src_id, dst_id, src_label, dst_label. Or, it should follow the multicorrespondence format, such as in ee_r264_correspondence.csv that specifies domain, attribute and size (but still follows multiple nested many-to-one relationships)

## nonchanging_class_indices

-   Description: To speed up processing, select which classes you know won"t change. For default seals7, this is the urban classes, the water classes, and the bare land class.

-   Default: \[0, 6, 7\]
-   Required: True
-   Examples: \[0, 6, 7\]

## coarse_src_label

-   Description: Label of the coarse LUC data that will be reclassified to the required coarse gridded projection data used as an input to the coarse gridded allocation.

-   Note: Becasue this is a correspondence file, it should either have columns for at least src_id, dst_id, src_label, dst_label. Or, it should follow the multicorrespondence format, such as in ee_r264_correspondence.csv that specifies domain, attribute and size (but still follows multiple nested many-to-one relationships)

# Coarse projections preproccessing

-   Description: These are mostly deprecated, but these keywords allow for automatically extracting the correct parts of potentially malformed netcdfs.

## time_dim_adjustment

-   Description: Often NetCDF files can have the time dimension in something other than just the year. This string allows for doing operations on the time dimension to match what is desired. e.g., multiply5 add2015
-   Type: string
-   Default: None
-   Required: True
-   Examples: "add2015"

## lc_class_varname

If "all_variables", assumes the LU classes will be the different variables named otherwise it can be a subset of variables, otherwise, if it is a named variable, e.g. LC_area_share then assume that the lc_class variable is

-   Required: True
-   Examples: "time"
