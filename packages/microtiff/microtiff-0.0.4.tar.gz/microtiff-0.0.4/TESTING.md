# Testing microtiff

Microtiff can be tested using the [test.sh](scripts/test.sh) script. This constitutes some basic unit tests of all supported sensors.

## Test data

Some test data has been sourced from projects with conflicting licensing, so only some tests are easily reproducible. For publicly avaliable data, sources are listed below.
