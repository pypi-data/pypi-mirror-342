# PAELLADOC - Interactive Documentation System

PAELLADOC is an interactive documentation system that focuses on a documentation-first approach to software projects. It uses natural language conversations to generate well-structured and comprehensive documentation before starting any code implementation.

## Starting a Documentation Project

To start using PAELLADOC, simply type the command:

```
PAELLA
```

This will initiate an interactive conversation to guide you through the process of creating documentation for your project.

## Key Features

- üìù **Documentation-First Approach**: Establish clear requirements and specifications before coding
- üó£Ô∏è **Natural Language Conversations**: Create documentation through guided conversations
- üìä **Template-Based Documentation**: Choose from a variety of document templates for different aspects of your project
- üîÑ **Iterative Documentation Process**: Build your documentation one document at a time
- üíæ **Project Memory**: Keeps track of your documentation progress and decisions
- üîç **Documentation Verification**: Ensures documentation remains consistent with code
- üñ•Ô∏è **Code Generation**: Generate code scaffolding based on your documentation

## Available Commands

- `PAELLA`: Start the documentation process
- `VERIFY`: Validate documentation against code
- `HELP`: Show available commands
- `CONTINUE`: Resume work on an existing documentation project
- `GENERATE_CODE`: Create code from documentation
- `CODING_STYLE`: Manage programming style guides
- `WORKFLOW`: Manage Git workflow methodologies
- `TEMPLATE`: Manage documentation templates

## How It Works

1. PAELLADOC asks for basic project information (name, purpose, target audience)
2. It presents a menu of available document templates
3. You select a document to create
4. PAELLADOC guides you through specific questions to complete the document
5. The process repeats for each document you want to create
6. All documentation is organized in a structured project folder

## Why Use PAELLADOC?

- **Reduce Technical Debt**: By documenting first, you avoid accumulating technical debt
- **Improve Communication**: Clear documentation helps team members understand the project
- **Increase Development Speed**: Well-defined requirements lead to faster implementation
- **Enhance Quality**: Documentation-first approach results in better designed systems
- **Facilitate Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the project
