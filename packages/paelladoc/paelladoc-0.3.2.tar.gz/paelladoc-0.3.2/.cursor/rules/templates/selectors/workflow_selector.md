# Git Workflow Selection Guide

This document outlines how PAELLADOC selects and applies appropriate Git workflow methodologies based on project characteristics and team requirements.

## Workflow Selection Criteria

### Project Size and Team Composition
PAELLADOC selects Git workflows according to project size and team composition:

| Project Size | Team Size | Recommended Workflow | Alternative Workflows |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Small | Solo (1 dev) | no_workflow | github_flow |
| Small | Small (2-4 devs) | github_flow | gitflow |
| Medium | Small-Medium (3-7 devs) | github_flow | trunk_based, gitflow |
| Medium | Medium (5-15 devs) | gitflow | trunk_based |
| Large | Medium-Large (10+ devs) | trunk_based | gitflow |
| Enterprise | Large (20+ devs) | trunk_based | Custom scaled workflow |

### Deployment Frequency
Different workflows suit different deployment frequencies:

| Deployment Frequency | Recommended Workflow | Features |
|----------------------|----------------------|---------|
| On-demand (irregular) | no_workflow / github_flow | Simplicity, flexibility |
| Scheduled (weekly/biweekly) | gitflow | Release planning, stability |
| Frequent (daily) | github_flow | Simple branching, quick integration |
| Continuous (multiple per day) | trunk_based | Feature flags, small commits |

### Project Characteristics
Specific project needs may influence workflow selection:

| Project Need | Suggested Workflow | Reason |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Formal releases | gitflow | Dedicated release branches |
| Rapid iteration | github_flow | Simple, quick merges |
| Continuous delivery | trunk_based | Main branch always deployable |
| Learning/prototyping | no_workflow | Minimal overhead |
| Multiple versions | gitflow | Support for multiple releases |
| Single version | github_flow / trunk_based | Simpler maintenance |

## Selection Process

1. During the `PAELLA` command initialization:
   - Project size and team composition are determined
   - Deployment frequency is established
   - Special project requirements are identified

2. Workflow application:
   - Primary workflow is selected based on criteria
   - Workflow documentation is generated
   - Specific git commands and practices are documented

3. MDC Generation:
   - The `GENERATE_MDC` command incorporates the selected workflow
   - Git workflow rules are referenced in the generated MDC file
   - Workflow guidance is included in the project documentation

## Workflow Customization

Project teams can customize the applied workflow by:

1. Selecting alternative branching models
2. Modifying naming conventions
3. Adjusting review processes
4. Adding or removing steps from the workflow
5. Creating a hybrid approach for specific project needs

## Workflow Application Examples

### Small Team Web Application
```json
{
  "project_size": "medium",
  "team_size": "small",
  "deployment_frequency": "weekly",
  "special_requirements": ["formal_releases"],
  "selected_workflow": "gitflow"
}
```

### Solo Developer Chrome Extension
```json
{
  "project_size": "small",
  "team_size": "solo",
  "deployment_frequency": "on_demand",
  "special_requirements": [],
  "selected_workflow": "no_workflow"
}
```

### Enterprise Application with Continuous Delivery
```json
{
  "project_size": "large",
  "team_size": "large",
  "deployment_frequency": "continuous",
  "special_requirements": ["high_availability", "feature_flags"],
  "selected_workflow": "trunk_based"
}
```

## Integration with Documentation

The Git workflow selection is documented in:
- The project overview document
- Development guides
- Onboarding documentation
- CI/CD pipeline documentation

Each document explains the workflow process, conventions, and any project-specific adaptations.
