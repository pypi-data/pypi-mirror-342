# GitHub Workflow Methodology

## Branching Strategy
- Use a feature branch workflow (GitHub Flow)
- Create branches from `main` for features, bugfixes, or improvements
- Keep branch names descriptive and prefixed with type: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `docs/`
- Delete branches after they are merged
- Consider branch protection rules for `main` and other important branches

## Commit Guidelines
- Write clear and concise commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Begin with a capital letter and no period at the end
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes
- Consider using conventional commits format: `type(scope): message`

## Pull Requests
- Create a PR for each significant change
- Use PR templates to ensure consistency
- Write descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Link PRs to issues they address using keywords (fixes, closes, resolves)
- Request relevant reviewers for each PR
- Address all review comments before merging

## Code Reviews
- Review code within 24 hours when possible
- Focus on logic, security, performance, and readability
- Be constructive and specific in comments
- Use GitHub's suggestion feature for small changes
- Approve only when all concerns are addressed
- Maintain a respectful and collaborative tone

## Issue Management
- Use issues for tracking bugs, features, and tasks
- Apply appropriate labels to categorize issues
- Assign issues to responsible team members
- Set milestones for planning
- Use issue templates for consistency
- Close issues with appropriate references to PRs

## CI/CD Integration
- Implement GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Run automated tests on PR creation and updates
- Run linters and code quality checks
- Add status checks as PR requirements
- Consider automated deployments for preview environments

## Project Management
- Use GitHub Projects for task organization
- Create project boards with appropriate columns
- Track progress using automated workflows
- Link PRs and issues to project cards
- Use GitHub milestones for release planning

## Documentation
- Update README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- Maintain a CONTRIBUTING.md file with contribution guidelines
- Document API changes in appropriate locations
- Keep a CHANGELOG.md for version history
- Update documentation as part of feature development

## Security Practices
- Enable security alerts for vulnerabilities
- Run security scanning in CI pipeline
- Review dependency changes carefully
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD configuration

## GitHub Features to Leverage
- Discussions for Q&A and open-ended conversation
- GitHub Pages for project documentation
- GitHub Actions for automation
- Dependabot for dependency updates
- Code Owners to automatically request reviews
