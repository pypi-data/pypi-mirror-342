## Development Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

We follow strict TDD practices in this project. Each feature or bug fix MUST follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:

1. **RED Phase** üî¥
   - Write a failing test first
   - Commit with prefix `test(red):` 
   - Example: `test(red): add test for MCP server plugin registration`

2. **GREEN Phase** üíö
   - Implement minimal code to make the test pass
   - Commit with prefix `feat(green):` 
   - Example: `feat(green): implement plugin registration`

3. **REFACTOR Phase** üîÑ
   - Clean up and optimize the code
   - Ensure tests remain green
   - Commit with prefix `refactor:` 
   - Example: `refactor: improve plugin registration efficiency`

Each PR should show this TDD cycle in the commit history. PRs without proper TDD commits will need revision.
