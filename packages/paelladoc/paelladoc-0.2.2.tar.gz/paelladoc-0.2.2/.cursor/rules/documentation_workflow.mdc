# PAELLADOC Documentation Workflow

This outlines the typical workflow when generating documentation, particularly when existing code context is provided.

## Workflow Steps (with Code Context)

1.  **Analyze Existing Code:**
    *   Scan project directory.
    *   Detect architectural patterns.
    *   Extract key components and modules.
    *   Analyze dependencies between components.

2.  **Generate Initial Documentation:**
    *   Create Architecture document outline.
    *   Draft API specifications (if applicable).
    *   Outline Database design (if applicable).

3.  **User Verification & Input:**
    *   Present analysis findings to the user.
    *   Request confirmation and clarification.
    *   Allow user modifications and additions.

4.  **Complete Documentation:**
    *   Fill documentation gaps based on user input.
    *   Incorporate business context and requirements.
    *   Validate documentation for completeness and accuracy.

## Integration Features

*   **Code Analysis Integration:** Documentation can be linked directly to source code.
*   **Automatic Updates:** Documentation can be configured to update automatically when code changes (requires setup).
