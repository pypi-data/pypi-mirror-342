# Next.js Coding Style Guide and Best Practices

## Project Structure
- Organize by feature rather than file type
- Use the `/app` directory for new projects, leveraging React Server Components
- Keep API routes in `/app/api` with a clear naming structure
- Place reusable UI components in `/components`
- Store global styles in `/styles` with component-specific styles alongside components
- Use `/lib` for utility functions and shared logic
- Store types and interfaces in `/types` or alongside their components
- Maintain constants and configuration in `/config`
- Keep middleware in a separate `/middleware` directory

## Core Conventions
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Follow a consistent naming convention (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)
- Implement proper error boundaries for fault tolerance
- Structure pages with clear, logical routing patterns
- Prefer functional components over class components
- Implement comprehensive metadata for SEO
- Document complex components with JSDoc or similar

## Component Architecture
- Create small, reusable components with single responsibilities
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript interfaces
- Use React.memo for components that render often with the same props
- Apply composition over inheritance for component extension
- Implement appropriate error boundaries around complex components
- Use React Context for state that needs to be accessed by many components
- Separate logic from presentation using custom hooks

## Routing and Navigation
- Use file-based routing according to Next.js conventions
- Implement dynamic routes for content-based pages
- Use shallow routing for URL updates without running data fetching methods
- Implement proper middleware for route protection and redirects
- Prefer Link component for client-side navigation
- Use Next.js router hooks for programmatic navigation
- Handle 404 pages with custom not-found pages

## Data Fetching
- Use React Server Components for server-side data fetching where appropriate
- Implement proper caching strategies using Next.js cache
- Use SWR or React Query for client-side data fetching with stale-while-revalidate
- Handle loading states and errors consistently
- Implement incremental static regeneration for semi-dynamic content
- Cache expensive operations where possible
- Use proper error boundaries around data-fetching components

## State Management
- Use React's useState and useReducer for local component state
- Implement React Context for global state when appropriate
- Consider Zustand, Jotai, or Redux for complex applications
- Keep state management consistent throughout the application
- Use server state management tools for remote data
- Document state management patterns used in the project
- Implement proper hydration techniques for server-rendered state

## Styling
- Use CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for component styling
- Maintain a consistent styling approach throughout the project
- Implement responsive design using modern CSS features
- Use CSS variables for theming and consistent values
- Consider component library integration for consistent UIs
- Optimize for dark mode and accessibility
- Use styled-jsx for component-scoped CSS when appropriate

## Performance Optimization
- Implement code-splitting with dynamic imports
- Use Image component for optimized image loading
- Implement proper lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Use Next.js automatic static optimization when possible
- Configure proper caching headers for static assets
- Monitor and optimize bundle size
- Implement virtualization for large lists
- Use web workers for CPU-intensive tasks

## SEO and Metadata
- Implement proper metadata for all pages using Next.js metadata API
- Create a comprehensive sitemap.xml strategy
- Implement structured data / JSON-LD for rich search results
- Use proper semantic HTML throughout
- Implement Open Graph and Twitter card metadata
- Use robots.txt for search engine crawling control
- Implement canonical URLs for duplicate content

## API Routes
- Structure API routes logically, mirroring frontend routes where appropriate
- Implement proper request validation
- Use consistent error handling and response formats
- Implement rate limiting for public APIs
- Add appropriate caching headers
- Secure endpoints with proper authentication and authorization
- Document API endpoints comprehensively

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Implement component tests for UI elements
- Write integration tests for key user flows
- Use end-to-end tests for critical paths
- Implement visual regression testing for UI components
- Mock external services and API calls in tests
- Aim for high test coverage on critical application paths

## Internationalization
- Use Next.js internationalization features for multi-language support
- Implement proper locale detection and switching
- Structure translations in an organized, maintainable way
- Support right-to-left languages where needed
- Consider cultural differences in UI design
- Use proper date, time, and number formatting based on locale
- Test thoroughly with different languages and RTL layouts

## Authentication and Authorization
- Implement secure authentication using trusted libraries or services
- Use proper JWT handling with secure cookies
- Implement role-based access control where appropriate
- Secure API routes with proper middleware
- Use Next.js middleware for route protection
- Implement proper session management
- Follow OWASP security best practices

## Deployment and Infrastructure
- Use Vercel or similar platforms for optimal Next.js deployment
- Implement proper environment variable management
- Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Use feature branches and preview deployments
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Configure proper error tracking
- Use content delivery networks for global performance

## Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards at minimum
- Implement proper semantic HTML
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the application
- Add proper ARIA attributes where needed
- Test with screen readers and accessibility tools
- Ensure sufficient color contrast and text sizing
- Implement proper focus management
