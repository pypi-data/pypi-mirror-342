**The open protocol and API format for enabling communication between humans and intelligent devices using the Kivai language.**

---

## üîå What is the Kivai Protocol?

The Kivai Protocol defines how devices, services, and applications interpret, exchange, and act on commands issued in the Kivai language.

It is designed to be:

- üí¨ **Language-agnostic** ‚Äî works with human speech or text in any language
- üì° **Platform-independent** ‚Äî usable on any device, OS, or ecosystem
- ü§ù **Interoperable** ‚Äî encourages communication between different devices, brands, and services
- üîì **Open & extensible** ‚Äî community-driven, built to evolve

---

## üì¶ Core Components

This repository will define:

- **Protocol schema** ‚Äì The standard format for Kivai commands and responses (JSON-based)
- **Intent API** ‚Äì A common API for devices to receive and respond to parsed Kivai commands
- **Context sharing** ‚Äì A mechanism for smart handoff and coordination between devices
- **Authentication & trust layer** ‚Äì Optional lightweight auth between trusted devices

## üß™ Examples

```json
{
  "command": "turn on",
  "object": "light",
  "location": "kitchen",
  "confidence": 0.97,
  "trigger": "Kivai",
  "language": "en",
  "user_id": "abc123"
}
```

## üîó Integration Goals

- Create SDKs and reference libraries (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
- Provide embeddable modules for smart devices
- Offer gateway support for legacy systems and cloud APIs

---

## üë• Who Should Use This?

- Device manufacturers
- Smart home tinkerers
- App developers
- AI & NLP researchers
- Anyone building human-centric technology

---

## üöÄ Roadmap

- ‚úÖ Define v0.1 protocol schema
- üî≤ Draft API structure and sample calls
- üî≤ Create reference implementation
- üî≤ Build mock devices and testbed
- üî≤ Write security & trust guidelines

## üôå Contribute

We‚Äôre building an open, human-first language for machines ‚Äî and we need you.  
Help define how technology listens, understands, and responds.

Open an issue. Propose a schema. Share an idea. Let‚Äôs create the future ‚Äî together.

### ‚úÖ Your Turn:
1. Replace your current README with this content.
2. Commit it with a message like:  
   **`Add protocol overview and goals to README`**

Let me know when that‚Äôs done and we‚Äôll move to the **next key piece** ‚Äî defining the actual **Kivai protocol schema (v0.1)**!

---

## üßæ Command Schema (v0.1)

You can find the official Kivai command schema here:  
[`schema/kivai-command.schema.json`](./schema/kivai-command.schema.json)

This JSON Schema defines how devices and services should interpret Kivai commands.  
It can be used to:

- Validate commands generated by NLP engines
- Ensure consistent formatting across platforms
- Build integrations for smart devices and systems

> The schema includes fields like `command`, `object`, `location`, `confidence`, `trigger`, and more.

More versions and extended schemas coming soon!

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Schema

Want to integrate Kivai into your app or device? Here‚Äôs how:

### üß™ Validate Commands
Make sure your command structure matches the official schema:

1. Go to [jsonschemavalidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net)
2. Paste the contents of [`kivai-command.schema.json`](./schema/kivai-command.schema.json) into the **Schema** box
3. Paste your Kivai command into the **Data** box
4. You should see `No errors found` when your command is valid ‚úÖ

### üîó Integrate It
You can use this schema to:

- Validate input from voice assistants or chatbots
- Power your own intent engine or device API
- Build smart home devices, apps, or Kivai-compatible tools

## Running the CLI Demo Script

You can use the `demo.py` script to interact with the mock devices.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need to install the `requests` library.

You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install requests

---

## üöÄ Running the Demo

### Prerequisites
Before running the demo, make sure you have installed the required dependencies. You can install the necessary library using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Running the Demo Script

1. Run the mock device server (e.g., `mock-thermostat.py`) by executing the following command:

```bash
python mock-thermostat.py
```

2. After the server is running, run the demo script to send requests to the server:

```bash
python demo.py
```

### Example Output

When the demo script runs successfully, you should see output like this:

```json
{
    "device_id": "kitchen-thermostat-01",
    "message": "Temperature set to 21¬∞C in kitchen",
    "status": "success",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-17T17:34:54.623009Z"
}
```

### Example Commands in the Demo Script

```python
import requests
import json

# Define the endpoint and headers
url = "http://127.0.0.1:5001/intent"
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Create a payload for the thermostat
payload = {
    "command": "set temperature",
    "object": "thermostat",
    "location": "kitchen",
    "temperature": 21
}

# Send POST request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Print the response from the server
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

### Notes
- Make sure the mock server is running before executing the demo script.
- This demo simulates the thermostat setting and checks the status of the device by sending JSON data to the server.
