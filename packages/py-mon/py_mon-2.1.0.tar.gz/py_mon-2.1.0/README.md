A modern, easy-to-use package to automatically restart a Python application when file changes are detected!

## Quickstart
I wanted to make this package as easy as possible to use. Here's a quick start, it's all you'll need üòº

### Installation
```
pip install -U py-mon
```
### Execution
```
pymon filename.py
```

That's pretty much it! üòå 

If you have a more sophisticated use-case, here are the available command line options:
- `--watch` (`-w`) to specify paths or patterns to watch. Examples: `src/*.py`, `data/**/*.json`. Default: `*.py`
- `--ignore` (`-i`) to specify patterns of files/paths to ignore. Use once for each pattern.
- `--exec` (`-x`) to execute a shell command instead of running a Python file.
- `--debug` (`-d`) to log detected file changes to the terminal.
- `--clean` (`-c`) to run pymon in clean mode (no logs, no commands).

#### Examples:
- `pymon test.py -w "*.json"` will monitor changes in Python (default) and JSON files in the current directory
- `pymon test.py -w "src/*.py" -w "data/*.json"` will monitor Python files in the src directory and JSON files in the data directory
- `pymon test.py -i "*.log" -i "*__pycache__*"` will ignore changes in log files and __pycache__ directories
- `pymon "python3 -m http.server" -x` will run the server and restart it when files change
- `pymon "npm run dev" -x -w "src/*.js" -w "src/*.jsx"` will run a Node.js dev server and monitor JavaScript files

### Command Input
When running pymon, you can use these commands:
- Type `rs` to manually restart the process
- Type `stop` to terminate pymon

## Inspiration
Back when I was 13, I spent a lot of time developing discord bots and it was a hassle to constantly `Ctrl+C` and then run the bot again on my terminal. Since I had just gotten started with web development back then, I decided to make something like  [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) but for Python so I randomly created this package one evening! I looked back at it a few weeks ago (I'm now 16) and realized over a thousand people download it every month so I quickly rewrote it (v2) to clean it up and add some new features!
