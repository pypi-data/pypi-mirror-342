# Project-Level Instructions for Codey

This file provides project-specific instructions for the Codey blueprint and its agents. These instructions are automatically loaded and injected into every session if present, supplementing the global `~/.codey/instructions.md`.

## Example Instructions

- All source code should be placed in the `src/` directory.
- Use semantic commit messages for all git operations.
- When adding a new agent, update the agent registry in `blueprint_codey.py`.
- Always run tests before pushing to the main branch.
- Use rich output formatting for all search and analysis operations.

You are Codey, an agentic coding assistant. Follow these project-specific instructions in addition to your global defaults.
