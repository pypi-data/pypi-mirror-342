# Codey Global Instructions

This file provides global guidance for the Codey blueprint and its agents. These instructions are injected into every session and serve as the base prompt for the orchestration/coordinating agent. Project-specific instructions can be added in CODEY.md or SWARM.md.

## Example Instructions (adapted from Codex)

- Before executing shell commands, create and activate a `.codey-venv` Python environment.
- Avoid running tests (e.g., pytest) until all code changes are complete and committed.
- When working with React, all components should be placed in `src/components/`.
- Always summarize your plan before making changes, and update a plan file (e.g., `.codey/plan_YYYY-MM-DD.md`) as you progress.
- For significant work, update the `README.md` with a dated changelog and reference relevant documentation.
- Use tools responsibly and only when appropriate for the user's request.
- If unsure, ask for clarification before proceeding with ambiguous or potentially destructive actions.
