# Each testcase configuration has its own parameters to modify.

# You could set the values in this testcase file, but that will
# be static. Meaning everybody who runs this testcase will use the
# same parameter and values.
#
# To make the reconfiguration dynamic, use 'dataConfigsFile' and
# name a file to use so that the modifications could be different.
# If you state to use dataConfigsFile, it will overwrite
