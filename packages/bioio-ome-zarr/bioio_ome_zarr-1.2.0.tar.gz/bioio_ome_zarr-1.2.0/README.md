A BioIO reader plugin for reading OME ZARR images using `ome-zarr`

---


## Documentation

[See the full documentation on our GitHub pages site](https://bioio-devs.github.io/bioio/OVERVIEW.html) - the generic use and installation instructions there will work for this package.

Information about the base reader this package relies on can be found in the `bioio-base` repository [here](https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio-base)

## Installation

**Stable Release:** `pip install bioio-ome-zarr`<br>
**Development Head:** `pip install git+https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio-ome-zarr.git`

## Example Usage (see full documentation for more examples)

Install bioio-ome-zarr alongside bioio:

`pip install bioio bioio-ome-zarr`


This example shows a simple use case for just accessing the pixel data of the image
by explicitly passing this `Reader` into the `BioImage`. Passing the `Reader` into
the `BioImage` instance is optional as `bioio` will automatically detect installed
plug-ins and auto-select the most recently installed plug-in that supports the file
passed in.
```python
from bioio import BioImage
import bioio_ome_zarr

img = BioImage("my_file.zarr", reader=bioio_ome_zarr.Reader)
img.data
```

### Reading from AWS S3
To read from private S3 buckets, [credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) must be configured. Public buckets can be accessed without credentials.
```python
from bioio import BioImage
path = "https://allencell.s3.amazonaws.com/aics/nuc-morph-dataset/hipsc_fov_nuclei_timelapse_dataset/hipsc_fov_nuclei_timelapse_data_used_for_analysis/baseline_colonies_fov_timelapse_dataset/20200323_09_small/raw.ome.zarr"
image = BioImage(path)
print(image.get_image_dask_data())
```
