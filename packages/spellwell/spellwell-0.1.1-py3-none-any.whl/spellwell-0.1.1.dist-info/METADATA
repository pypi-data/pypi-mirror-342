# SpellWell

`SpellWell` is a CLI application which allows you to practice spelling using your own wordlist directly in your terminal.

To combat the problem of forgetting how to spell words because of autocomplete features in text editors, the `spellwell` CLI allows you to add words to your own wordlist and practice spelling them by having them blanked out in example sentences.

`SpellWell` comes with the non-feature of being completely free of AI usage and it's ran locally on your own machine. It's free and open source (MIT license).

It's therefore important that you add the correct spelled words to your wordlist.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pipx install spellwell

# Add a tricky word
spellwell add accommodate --sentence "I can accommodate up to five people."

# Add more words interactively
spellwell add

# Practice your spelling
spellwell practice

# View your progress
spellwell stats
```

## Installation

### Recommended: Install with pipx (isolated environment)

```bash
# Install pipx if you don't have it already
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath

# Install SpellWell
pipx install spellwell
```

Alternatively, install directly with pip:

```bash
pip install spellwell
```

After installation, you can use the `spellwell` command directly from your terminal.
