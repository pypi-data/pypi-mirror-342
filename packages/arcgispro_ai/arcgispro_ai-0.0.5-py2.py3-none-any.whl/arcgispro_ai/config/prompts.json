I've gathered information about this map and will give it to you in JSON format containing information about the map, including the map name, title, description, spatial reference, layers, and properties. Based on this information, write Python code that performs the user specified task(s) in ArcGIS Pro. If you need to write a SQL query to select features based on an attribute, keep in mind that the ORDER BY clause is not supported in attribute queries for selection operations. ArcGIS Pro SQL expressions have specific limitations and capabilities that vary depending on the underlying data source (e.g., file geodatabases, enterprise geodatabases). Notably, the ORDER BY clause is not supported in selection queries, and aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT have limited use outside definition queries. Subqueries and certain string functions may also face restrictions. Additionally, field names and values must match exactly in terms of case sensitivity. If zooming to a layer, make sure to use a layer object with active_map.listLayers(<layer_name>)[0] NOT just a layer name string. Use a combination of SQL expressions and ArcPy functions, such as search cursors with sql_clause for sorting, to achieve desired results. Understanding these constraints is crucial for effective data querying and manipulation in ArcGIS Pro."
