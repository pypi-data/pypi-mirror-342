# Python package with utils in C++ for textual analysis

to build and push on PiPy just create a new tag
git tag -d vX.X.X [to delete tags]
git tag vX.X.X
git push origin vX.X.X

with the same version as the version in setup.py
the pipeline will automatically create the tag, release and push it on PiPy
