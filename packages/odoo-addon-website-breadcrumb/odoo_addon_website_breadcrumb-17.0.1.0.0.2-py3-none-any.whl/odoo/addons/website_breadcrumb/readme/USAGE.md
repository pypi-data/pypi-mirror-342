To use this module, you need to:

1. Log in.
2. Go to your home page and click on the body of the page.
3. Open the web editor and go to the **Customise** tab.
4. Enable **Breadcrumbs** (it is enabled by default).

- If you want to use this module in a theme but you do not like where it
  is rendered, you can simply disable it in the top menu and add in you
  own layout a `<t t-call="website_breadcrumb.breadcrumb"/>` element.
