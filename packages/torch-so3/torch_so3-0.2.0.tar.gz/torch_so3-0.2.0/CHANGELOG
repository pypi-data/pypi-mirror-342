- Renamed the `refine_search` submodule to `local_so3_sampling`.
- Added the major functions `get_uniform_euler_angles` and `get_local_high_resolution_angles` to the top-level module for ease of access.

[v0.1.1] - 2024-02-19

- Fixed minor issues where order of Euler angles from `get_uniform_euler_angles` was not consistent.
- Renamed the `hopf_angles` submodule to `uniform_so3_sampling`.
