# fmc_openapi

**fmc_openapi** is a Python package that simplifies interaction with Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) APIs. It dynamically parses the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification to discover available endpoints and interact with them using the `operationId`.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Parses the Swagger file to discover endpoints
- 💡 Calls API operations by operationId
- 🔐 Session handling (login/logout)
- 🧰 Simplifies complex API interactions
- ⚠️ Error handling built-in
- 🏢 SCC/CDO Token-Based Authentication
- 🔄 Automatic pagination handling (manual pagination is also possible)
- 📦 Bulk operations
- 📄 All endpoints defined in the Swagger spec

## 🧑‍💻 Usage Example

### Connecting to FMC (username/password)

```python
from fmc_openapi import FMCOpenAPIClient

with FMCOpenAPIClient(
    hostname="fmc.example.com",
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    verify=False
) as fmc:
    domains = fmc.operation("getAllDomain")
```

### Connecting to SCC (token-based)

```python
from fmc_openapi import FMCOpenAPIClient

with FMCOpenAPIClient(
    hostname="scc.example.com",
    token="your_token_here",
    verify=False
) as fmc:
    domains = fmc.operation("getAllDomain")
```

---

### Get all access policy rules

```python
import jmespath

with FMCOpenAPIClient(
    hostname="fmc.example.com",
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    verify=False
) as fmc:
    # Get domain UUID
    domains = fmc.operation("getAllDomain")
    domain_uuid = jmespath.search("items[?name=='my-domain'].uuid | [0]", domains)

    # Get ACP UUID
    acp_response = fmc.operation("getAllAccessPolicy", domainUUID=domain_uuid)
    acp_uuid = jmespath.search("items[?name=='my-policy'].uuid | [0]", acp_response)

    # Get all access policy rules (with automatic pagination)
    rules = fmc.operation(
        "getAllAccessRule", 
        limit=1000, 
        domainUUID=domain_uuid, 
        containerUUID=acp_uuid, 
        expanded=True
    )
```

---

### Manual Pagination

```python
rules = fmc.operation(
    "getAllAccessRule",
    limit=1000,
    domainUUID=domain_uuid,
    containerUUID=acp_uuid,
    expanded=True,
    manual_pagination=True
)
```

---

### Creating Objects

```python
payload = {
    "name": "obj-192.168.1.0",
    "type": "Network",
    "value": "192.168.1.0/24",
}

fmc.operation("createMultipleNetworkObject", payload=payload, domainUUID=domain_uuid)
```

---

### Bulk Operations

```python
response = fmc.operation(
    "getHitCount", 
    limit=1000, 
    domainUUID=domain_uuid, 
    containerUUID=ac_uuid_selected, 
    filter=f"deviceId:{device_uuid}", 
    expanded=True,
    bulk=True
)
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

Tests are written using `pytest`.

To run tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Or activate the environment first:

```bash
poetry shell
pytest
```
