**Official Documentation**

For more information about the XBRL API and its endpoints, refer to the original API documentation at https://xbrlus.github.io/xbrl-api.


2. Choose Your Preferred Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two distinct ways to use the XBRL-US Python package:

* **Code-Based Approach**: Import the XBRL-US Python package directly into your Python
  environment for in-depth, custom analysis (see **Code-Based Approach**)

* **Browser Interface**: For a no-code experience, navigate to the **Browser Interface**.
  This interface allows for easy exploration and analysis of XBRL data directly in your web
  browser.

.. _code-based approach:

2.1. Code-Based Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import the XBRL Library
-------------------------------

To start using the XBRL-US library,
you need to import it into your Python script:

.. code-block:: python

    from xbrl_us import XBRL

Create an Instance of XBRL Class
----------------------------------------

Next, you need to create an instance of the ``XBRL`` class,
providing your authentication credentials
(client ID, client secret, username, and password) as parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    xbrl = XBRL(
    client_id='Your client id',
    client_secret='Your client secret',
    username='Your username',
    password='Your password'
    )

Make sure to replace ``Your client id``,
``Your client secret``, ``Your username``, and
``Your password`` with your actual credentials.

Query the XBRL API
------------------

The XBRL-US library provides a query method to search
for data from the XBRL API. You can specify various
parameters and fields to filter and retrieve the
desired data.

Here's an example of using the query method to search
for specific financial facts:

.. code-block:: python

    response = xbrl.query(
        method='fact search',
        parameters={
            "concept.local-name": [
                'OperatingIncomeLoss',
                'GrossProfit',
                'OperatingExpenses',
                'OtherOperatingIncomeExpenseNet'
            ],
            "period.fiscal-year": [2009, 2010],
            "report.sic-code": range(2800, 2899)
        },
        fields=[
            'report.accession',
            'period.fiscal-year',
            'period.end',
            'period.fiscal-period',
            'fact.ultimus',
            'unit',
            'concept.local-name',
            'fact.value',
            'fact.id',
            'entity.id',
            'entity.cik',
            'entity.name',
            'report.sic-code',
        ],
        limit=100,
        as_dataframe=True
    )

In this example, we are searching for facts related
to specific concepts, fiscal years, and SIC codes.
We are also specifying the fields we want to retrieve
in the response. The ``limit`` parameter restricts the
number of facts returned to 100, and ``as_dataframe=True``
ensures the response is returned as a ``Pandas DataFrame``.

Perform Additional Queries
----------------------------------

You can use the same query method to call other API
endpoints by changing the method parameter and
providing the relevant parameters and fields.

Here's an example of using the query method to
search for a specific fact by its ID:

.. code-block:: python

    response = xbrl.query(
    method='fact id',
    parameters={'fact.id': 123},
    fields=[
        'report.accession',
        'period.fiscal-year',
        'period.end',
        'period.fiscal-period',
        'fact.ultimus',
        'unit',
        'concept.local-name',
        'fact.value',
        'fact.id',
        'entity.id',
        'entity.cik',
        'entity.name',
        'report.sic-code',
    ],
    as_dataframe=False
    )

Congratulations! You have learned how to use the XBRL-US Python library to interact with the XBRL API.
In this example you will receive the data in json format as the ``as_dataframe`` parameter is set to ``False``.

Using Specialized Methods
--------------------------

The XBRL-US library now includes two specialized methods, ``xbrl.fact`` and ``xbrl.report``, which are tailored versions of the ``query`` method. These methods provide detailed type suggestions and definitions for their parameters, making it easier to construct valid API requests and reducing the chance of errors.

The example below demonstrates how to retrieve exactly the same data as the query shown above. The key advantage is the enhanced autocompletion and IDE suggestions, which significantly improve your development experience:

.. code-block:: python

    response = xbrl.fact(
        endpoint='/fact/search',
        fields=[
            'report.accession',
            'period.fiscal-year',
            'period.end',
            'period.fiscal-period',
            'fact.ultimus',
            'unit',
            'concept.local-name',
            'fact.value',
            'fact.id',
            'entity.id',
            'entity.cik',
            'entity.name',
            'report.sic-code',
        ],
        parameters={
            "concept_local_name": [
                'OperatingIncomeLoss',
                'GrossProfit',
                'OperatingExpenses',
                'OtherOperatingIncomeExpenseNet'
            ],
            "period_fiscal_year": [2009, 2010],
            "report_sic_code": range(2800, 2899)
        },
        limit=100,
        as_dataframe=True
    )

**Why Use Specialized Methods?**

Unlike the generic ``query`` method, these specialized methods:

* Offer precise type hints for fields, parameters, and sorting options
* Align with the XBRL US API structure, using proper endpoint naming conventions
* Simplify query construction with IDE-guided valid options
* Include definitions for each parameter
* Simplify the process of building queries by guiding you with valid options directly in your IDE

These specialized methods work similarly to ``query`` but are specific to their respective data types and provide better IDE support through type hints.

.. note::
    While the ``query`` method is still available, we recommend using ``xbrl.fact`` and ``xbrl.report`` for a more guided and error-resistant experience.

.. _browser interface:
