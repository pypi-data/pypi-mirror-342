We love contributions from our community! This guide explains how to get involved and contribute to CocoIndex.

## Setting Up Development Environment

-   Install Rust toolchain: [docs](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)

-   (Optional) Setup Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    virtualenv --python=$(which python3.12) .venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment, before any installings / buildings / runnings:

    ```bash
    . .venv/bin/activate
    ```

-   Install maturin:
    ```bash
    pip install maturin
    ```

-   Build the library. Run at the root of cocoindex directory:
    ```bash
    maturin develop
    ```

-   (Optional) Before running a specific example, set extra environment variables, for exposing extra traces, allowing dev UI, etc.
    ```bash
    . ./.env.lib_debug
    ```
