# GLLM Generation

## Description

A library containing generation related components in Gen AI applications.

## Installation

1. Python v3.11 or above:

You can install Python using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).

2. Make sure you're in the `base` conda environment:
```bash
conda activate
```

3. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) v1.8.1 or above:

You can install Poetry using cURL (you need Python to install Poetry):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

4. Install the library using Poetry:
```bash
# Latest
poetry add "git+ssh://git@github.com/GDP-ADMIN/gen-ai-internal.git#subdirectory=libs/gllm-generation"

# Specific version
poetry add "git+ssh://git@github.com/GDP-ADMIN/gen-ai-internal.git@gllm_generation-v0.0.1-beta.1#subdirectory=libs/gllm-generation"

# Specific Branch Name
poetry add "git+ssh://git@github.com/GDP-ADMIN/gen-ai-internal.git@<BRANCH NAME>#subdirectory=libs/gllm-generation"
```

5. At this step, you can deactivate Miniconda environment as Poetry will create and manage its own virtual environment for you.
```bash
conda deactivate
```

## Managing Dependencies
1. Go to root folder of `gllm-generation` module, e.g. `cd libs/gllm-generation`.
2. Run `poetry shell` to create a virtual environment.
3. Run `poetry lock` to create a lock file if you haven't done it yet.
4. Run `poetry install` to install the `gllm-generation` requirements for the first time.
5. Run `poetry update` if you update any dependency module version at `pyproject.toml`.


## Contributing
Please refer to this [Python Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uRggCrHnVfDPBnG641FyQBwUwLoFw0kTzNqRm92vUwM/edit?usp=sharing)
to get information about code style, documentation standard, and SCA that you need to use when contributing to this project

1. Activate `pre-commit` hooks using `pre-commit install`
2. Run `poetry shell` to create a virtual environment.
3. Run `poetry lock` to create a lock file if you haven't done it yet.
4. Run `poetry install` to install the `gllm-generation` requirements for the first time.
5. Run `which python` to get the path to be referenced at Visual Studio Code interpreter path (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` or `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P`)
6. Try running the unit test to see if it's working:
```bash
poetry run pytest -s tests/unit_tests/
```
