title: Unit Testing

CI pipelines are the core of all mature software engineering practices. 

**With LLMs, developers should expect nothing less.** 
Using `judgeval`, you can easily unit test your LLM applications for consistency and quality in any metric of your choice.

Unit testing is natively supported in `judgeval` through the `client.assert_test` method. 
**This also integrates with `pytest`, meaning you won't have to learn any new testing frameworks!**

```python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import FaithfulnessScorer

def test_faithfulness():
    client = JudgmentClient()
    
    example = Example(
        input="What is the capital of France?",
        actual_output="The capital of France is Lyon.",
        retrieval_context=["Come tour Paris' museums in the capital of France!"],
    )

    # Example contains a hallucination, so we should expect an exception
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError):
        client.assert_test(
            eval_run_name="test_eval",
            examples=[example],
            scorers=[FaithfulnessScorer(threshold=1.0)],
        )
```

`judgeval` naturally integrates into your CI pipelines, allowing you to execute robust unit tests across your entire codebase. 
**This allows you to catch regressions in your LLM applications before they make it to production!**
