title: Custom Scorers
description: ""
---

If none of `judgeval`'s built-in scorers fit your evaluation criteria, you can easily build your own custom metric to be run through a `JudgevalScorer`. 

`JudgevalScorer`s are **automatically integrated** within `judgeval`'s infrastructure, so you can:
- Run your own scorer with the same syntax as any other `judgeval` scorer.
- Use `judgeval`'s batched evaluation infrastructure to execute **scalable evaluation runs**.
- Have your scorer's results be viewed and analyzed in the Judgment platform.

<Tip>
Be creative with your custom scorers! You can measure **anything** you want using a `JudgevalScorer`, 
including using evaluations that aren't LLM judge-based such as ROUGE or embedding similarity.
</Tip>

## Guidelines for Implementing Custom Scorers

To implement your own custom scorer, you must:

### 1. Inherit from the `JudgevalScorer` class

This will help `judgeval` integrate your scorer into evaluation runs.

```python custom_scorer.py
from judgeval.scorers import JudgevalScorer

class SampleScorer(JudgevalScorer):
    ...
```

### 2. Implement the `__init__()` method

`JudgevalScorer`s have some required attributes that must be determined in the `__init__()` method. 
For instance, you must set a `threshold` to determine what constitutes success/failure for a scorer. 

There are additional optional attributes that can be set here for even more flexibility:
- `score_type (str)`: The name of your scorer. This will be displayed in the Judgment platform.
- `include_reason (bool)`: Whether your scorer includes a reason for the score in the results. Only for LLM judge-based scorers.
- `async_mode (bool)`: Whether your scorer should be run asynchronously during evaluations.
- `strict_mode (bool)`: Whether your scorer fails if the score is not perfect (1.0).
- `verbose_mode (bool)`: Whether your scorer produces verbose logs.
- `custom_example (bool)`: Whether your scorer should be run on custom examples.

```python custom_scorer.py
class SampleScorer(JudgevalScorer):
    def __init__(
        self,
        threshold=0.5,
        score_type="Sample Scorer",
        include_reason=True,
        async_mode=True,
        strict_mode=False,
        verbose_mode=True
    ):
        super().__init__(score_type=score_type, threshold=threshold)
        self.threshold = 1 if strict_mode else threshold
        # Optional attributes
        self.include_reason = include_reason
        self.async_mode = async_mode
        self.strict_mode = strict_mode
        self.verbose_mode = verbose_mode
```

### 3. Implement the `score_example()` and `a_score_example()` methods

The `score_example()` and `a_score_example()` methods take an `Example` object and execute your scorer to produce a score (float) between 0 and 1. 
Optionally, you can include a reason to accompany the score if applicable (e.g. for LLM judge-based scorers). 

The only requirement for `score_example()` and `a_score_example()` is that they:
- Take an `Example` as an argument (you can add other arguments too)
- Set the `self.score` attribute
- Set the `self.success` attribute

You can optionally set the self.reason attribute, depending on your preference.

<Note>
`a_score_example()` is simply the async version of `score_example()`, so the implementation should largely be identical.
</Note>

These methods are the core of your scorer, and you can implement them in any way you want. **Be creative!** 

#### Handling Errors
If you want to handle errors gracefully, you can use a `try` block and in the `except` block, set the `self.error` attribute to the error message. 
This will allow `judgeval` to catch the error but **still execute the rest of an evaluation run**, assuming you have multiple examples to evaluate.

Here's a sample implementation that integrates everything we've covered:

```python custom_scorer.py
class SampleScorer(JudgevalScorer):
    ...

    def score_example(self, example, ...):
        try:
            self.score = run_scorer_logic(example)
            if self.include_reason:
                self.reason = justify_score(example, self.score)
            if self.verbose_mode:
                self.verbose_logs = make_logs(example, self.reason, self.score)
            self.success = self.score >= self.threshold
        except Exception as e:
            self.error = str(e)
            self.success = False
    
    async def a_score_example(self, example, ...):
        try:
            self.score = await a_run_scorer_logic(example)  # async version
            if self.include_reason:
                self.reason = justify_score(example, self.score)
            if self.verbose_mode:
                self.verbose_logs = make_logs(example, self.reason, self.score)
            self.success = self.score >= self.threshold
        except Exception as e:
            self.error = str(e)
            self.success = False
```


### 4. Implement the `_success_check()` method

When executing an evaluation run, `judgeval` will check if your scorer has passed the `_success_check()` method. 

You can implement this method in any way you want, but **it should return a `bool`.** Here's a perfectly valid implementation:

```python custom_scorer.py
class SampleScorer(JudgevalScorer):
    ...

    def _success_check(self):
        if self.error is not None:
            return False
        return self.score >= self.threshold  # or you can do self.success if set
```

### 5. Give your scorer a name

This is so that when displaying your scorer's results in the Judgment platform, you can easily sort by and find your scorer.

```python custom_scorer.py
class SampleScorer(JudgevalScorer):
    ...

    @property
    def __name__(self):
        return "Sample Scorer"
```
**Congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ 

You've made your first custom judgeval scorer! Now that your scorer is implemented, you can run it on your own datasets 
just like any other `judgeval` scorer. Your scorer is fully integrated with `judgeval`'s infrastructure so you can view it on 
the [Judgment platform](/judgment/introduction) too.

## Using a Custom Scorer

Once you've implemented your custom scorer, you can use it in the same way as any other scorer in `judgeval`. 
They can be run in conjunction with other scorers in a single evaluation run!

```python run_custom_scorer.py
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from your_custom_scorer import SampleScorer

client = JudgmentClient()
sample_scorer = SampleScorer()

results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example1],
    scorers=[sample_scorer],
    model="gpt-4o"
)
```
## Custom Scorers with Custom Examples

If you want to use a custom scorer with a [custom example](/evaluation/data_examples#custom-examples), you can do so by passing the custom scorer and custom example to the `run_evaluation()` method.

<Note>
Make sure to set the `custom_example` attribute to `True` in the `__init__()` method of your custom scorer.
</Note>

```python run_custom_scorer.py
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import CustomExample

client = JudgmentClient()
custom_example = CustomExample(
    input={
        "question": "What if these shoes don't fit?",
    },
    actual_output={
        "answer": "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
    },
    expected_output={
        "answer": "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
    },
)

scorer = CustomScorer(threshold=0.5) # Your custom scorer
results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[custom_example],
    scorers=[scorer],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)
```
