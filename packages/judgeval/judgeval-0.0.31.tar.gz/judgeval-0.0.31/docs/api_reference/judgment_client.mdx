title: Judgment Client
---

The `JudgmentClient` is the main interface for interacting with the Judgment API.

## Initializing the Judgment Client

A client can be initialized using an API key. **To receive an API key**, please send us an email at contact@judgmentlabs.ai.

Setting the `JUDGMENT_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key allows you to initialize the client without passing an API key to the constructor.

```bash
export JUDGMENT_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

```python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient

client = JudgmentClient()
```

## Running an Evaluation

The `client.run_evaluation` method is the primary method for executing evaluations.

```python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.scorers import FaithfulnessScorer
from judgeval.data import Example

client = JudgmentClient()

example = Example(
    input="What is the capital of France?",  # replace this with your system input
    actual_output="Paris",  # replace this with your LLM's output
    retrieval_context=["France has many cities, including the capital Paris, Lyon, and Marseille."]  # replace this with your RAG contents
)

results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[FaithfulnessScorer(threshold=0.5)],
    model="gpt-4o",
)
```

The `run_evaluation` method has the following keyword arguments:
- `examples`: A list of [Example](/evaluation/data_examples) objects to evaluate.
- `model`: The model to use for the evaluation, such as GPT-4o or QWEN.
- `scorers`: A list of [Scorer](/evaluation/scorers) objects to use for the evaluation.
- `use_judgment`: Whether to use Judgment's infrastructure to execute the evaluation. Defaults to `True`.
- `log_results`: Whether to log the results of the evaluation to the Judgment platform. Defaults to `True`.
- `override`: Whether to override an existing evaluation with the same name. Defaults to `False`.
- `append`: Whether to append the results of the evaluation to an existing evaluation with the same name. Defaults to `False`.
- `project_name`: The name of the project to use for the evaluation. Defaults to `"default_project"`.
- `eval_run_name`: The name of the evaluation run. Defaults to `"default_eval_run"`.

<Tip>
In Judgment, **projects** are used to organize workflows, while **evaluation runs** 
are used to group versions of a workflow for comparative analysis of evaluations. 
As a result, you can think of projects as folders, and evaluation runs as sub-folders that contain evaluation results.
