# Notifications

Notifications allow you to receive alerts through various communication channels when your [rules](/alerts/rules) are triggered. This feature helps you stay informed about potential issues with your AI system's performance in real-time.

## Overview

The notification system works with [rules](/alerts/rules) to:

1. Monitor your evaluation metrics
2. Check if they meet your defined [conditions](/alerts/rules#conditions)
3. Send alerts through your preferred channels when conditions are met

Notifications can be configured globally or per rule, allowing you to customize how you're alerted based on the specific rule that was triggered.

<Warning>
Rules and notifications only work with built-in APIScorers. Local scorers and custom scorers are not supported for triggering notifications.
</Warning>

## Notification Configuration

Notifications are configured using the `NotificationConfig` class from the `judgeval.rules` module.

### Configuration Options

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | Whether notifications are enabled (default: `True`) |
| `communication_methods` | list of strings | The methods to use for sending notifications (e.g., `["email", "slack"]`) |
| `email_addresses` | list of strings | Email addresses to send notifications to |
| `send_at` | integer (Unix timestamp) | Schedule notifications for a specific time ([learn more](#scheduled-notifications)) |

<Note>
For aggregated reports and periodic summaries of multiple alerts, use the [Scheduled Reports feature](/alerts/platform_notifications#scheduled-reports-recaps) in the Judgment Platform.
</Note>

### Basic Configuration

```python
from judgeval.rules import NotificationConfig

# Create a notification configuration
notification_config = NotificationConfig(
    enabled=True,
    communication_methods=["slack", "email"],
    email_addresses=["user@example.com"],
    send_at=None  # Send immediately
)
```

## Communication Methods

Judgeval supports multiple communication methods for notifications:

- `"email"`: Send emails to specified email addresses
- `"slack"`: Send messages to configured Slack channels

You can configure multiple methods to be used simultaneously.

## Slack Integration

For detailed information on integrating Slack with Judgment notifications, see the [Platform Notification Center documentation](/alerts/platform_notifications#slack-integration).

## Attaching Notifications to Rules

Notifications can be attached to [rules](/alerts/rules) during rule creation or added/configured later.

### During Rule Creation

```python
from judgeval.rules import Rule, Condition, NotificationConfig
from judgeval.scorers import FaithfulnessScorer

# Create notification config
notification_config = NotificationConfig(
    enabled=True,
    communication_methods=["slack", "email"],
    email_addresses=["user@example.com"]
)

# Create rule with notification config
rule = Rule(
    name="Faithfulness Check",
    description="Check if faithfulness meets threshold",
    conditions=[
        # Note: Only built-in APIScorers are supported
        Condition(metric=FaithfulnessScorer(threshold=0.7))
    ],
    combine_type="all",  # Trigger when all conditions fail (see Combine Types in Rules documentation)
    notification=notification_config
)
```

## Scheduled Notifications

You can schedule one-time notifications to be sent at a specific time using the `send_at` parameter:

```python
from judgeval.rules import NotificationConfig
import time

# Schedule notification for 1 hour from now
one_hour_from_now = int(time.time()) + 3600

notification_config = NotificationConfig(
    enabled=True,
    communication_methods=["email"],
    email_addresses=["user@example.com"],
    send_at=one_hour_from_now
)
```

The `send_at` parameter accepts a Unix timestamp (integer) that specifies when the notification should be sent. This is useful for delaying notifications or grouping them to be sent at a specific time of day.

<Warning>
The `send_at` parameter only delays when a single notification is sent. It doesn't create recurring notifications or group multiple alerts together. Each time a rule is triggered, a separate notification is generated.
</Warning>

## Notification Types in the Platform

The Judgment Platform offers two main types of notifications:

1. **Evaluation Alerts** - Real-time notifications sent when specific rules are triggered. When using the API, these can be scheduled for a specific time using the `send_at` parameter.

2. **Custom Alert Recaps** - Periodic summaries (daily, weekly, monthly) of evaluation metrics and alerts. These are configured in the [Platform Notification Center](/alerts/platform_notifications).

### Setting Up Custom Alert Recaps

To set up periodic notification summaries:

1. Navigate to the Notifications page in your Judgment account settings
2. Under "Custom Alert Recaps," click the "+" button to create a new report
3. Configure your preferred frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) and delivery time
4. Add recipient email addresses

For more details, see the [Scheduled Reports](/alerts/platform_notifications#scheduled-reports-recaps) documentation.

## Judgment Platform Features

For information about configuring notifications in the Judgment web platform, including email alerts, scheduled reports, and Slack integration, see the [Platform Notification Center](/alerts/platform_notifications) documentation.

## Practical Example

Here's a complete example showing how to set up rules with notifications and integrate them with the Tracer:

```python
import os
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from judgeval.scorers import FaithfulnessScorer, AnswerRelevancyScorer
from judgeval.rules import Rule, Condition, NotificationConfig
from openai import OpenAI

# Create notification config
notification_config = NotificationConfig(
    enabled=True,
    communication_methods=["slack", "email"],
    email_addresses=["alerts@example.com"],
    send_at=None  # Send immediately
)

# Create rules with notification config
rules = [
    Rule(
        name="Quality Check",
        description="Check if all quality metrics meet thresholds",
        conditions=[
            # Only built-in APIScorers can be used as metrics
            Condition(metric=FaithfulnessScorer(threshold=0.7)),
            Condition(metric=AnswerRelevancyScorer(threshold=0.8))
        ],
        combine_type="all",  # Trigger when all conditions fail
        notification=notification_config
    )
]

# Initialize tracer with rules for notifications
judgment = Tracer(
    api_key=os.getenv("JUDGMENT_API_KEY"), 
    project_name="my_project", 
    rules=rules
)

# Wrap OpenAI client for tracing
client = wrap(OpenAI())

# Now any evaluations that trigger the rules will send notifications
```
