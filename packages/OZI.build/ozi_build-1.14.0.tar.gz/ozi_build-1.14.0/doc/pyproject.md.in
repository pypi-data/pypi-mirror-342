# Configuration

OZI.build only supports reading configuration from `pyproject.toml`.
This file lives at the root of the module/package, at the same place
as the toplevel `meson.build` file.

## Build system section

This tells tools like pip to build your project with flit. It's a standard
defined by PEP 517. For any project using OZI.build, it will look something like this:

``` toml
    [build-system]
    requires = ["OZI.build[core]~=1.9"]
    build-backend = "ozi_build.buildapi"
```

## Project section

This holds the essential project metadata that is outside of the ``meson.build`` file.
Some keys remain in the project table for improved cross-compatibility.
It should look similar to this in an OZI.build project:

``` toml
    [project]
    dynamic = ["version"]
    dependencies = [
    'TAP-Producer~=1.0.4',
    ]

    [project.license]
    file = "LICENSE.txt"

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    ...
```

## Metadata section

> NOTE: The project version and name are extracted from the `meson.build`
> [`project()`](http://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html#project) section.

This section is called `[tool.ozi-build.metadata]` in the file.

{fields_desc}
## ``pyc_wheel`` configuration

This section is called `[tool.ozi-build.pyc_wheel]` in the file.

{pyc_wheel_desc}
## Entry points section (Optional)

You can declare [entry points](http://entrypoints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
in the `[tools.ozi-build.entry-points]` section. It is a list of
'entrypointname = module:funcname` strings, for example for console
scripts entry points:

``` toml
[tool.ozi-build.entry-points]
console_scripts = [
    'otioview = opentimelineview.console:main',
    'otiocat = opentimelineio.console.otiocat:main',
    'otioconvert = opentimelineio.console.otioconvert:main',
    'otiostat = opentimelineio.console.otiostat:main',
    'otioautogen_serialized_schema_docs = opentimelineio.console.autogen_serialized_datamodel:main',
]
```
