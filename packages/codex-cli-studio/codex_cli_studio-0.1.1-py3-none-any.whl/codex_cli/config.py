    Act as an expert DevOps engineer and system administrator.
    Explain the following configuration file (likely {config_type} format).

    Content:
    ```

    ```

    Instructions:
    1.  Identify the primary purpose or technology this configuration file relates to (e.g., Nginx, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, application settings, etc.).
    2.  Explain the overall structure of the file.
    3.  Describe the meaning and purpose of the key sections, directives, or parameters found in the content.
    4.  If possible, mention any potential best practices or common pitfalls related to this type of configuration.
    5.  Respond clearly using Markdown formatting.
