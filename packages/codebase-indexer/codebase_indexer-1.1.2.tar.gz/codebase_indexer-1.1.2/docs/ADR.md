# ADR 001: Command-Line Tool for Indexing Large Codebase with OpenAI, Pinecone, and Claude

## Context

The objective is to develop a command-line tool that indexes a large codebase and enables an AI agent to understand and interact with it, answering questions and assisting in development tasks. The tool must accept a path to any codebase directory, index its contents, and support semantic search and retrieval of code snippets. The solution should be scalable, efficient, and leverage modern technologies with easy-to-build SDKs. The implementation will be structured into clear milestones for phased development. The proposed approach uses OpenAI's embedding model for generating code embeddings, Pinecone DB for storing these embeddings, and Anthropic's Claude as the large language model (LLM) for the agent, integrated via LangChain.

## Decision

We will develop a command-line tool using the following technologies:

- **Embedding Model**: OpenAI's text embedding model (e.g., [text-embedding-ada-002](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)) to generate embeddings for code chunks. OpenAI's general-purpose model is widely adopted and supported by robust SDKs, suitable for indexing diverse codebases.
- **Vector Database**: [Pinecone DB](https://docs.pinecone.io/integrations/openai) for storing embeddings, optimized for scalable semantic search and compatible with OpenAI's embeddings.
- **LLM for Agent**: Anthropic's Claude model, accessible via the [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs), for generating responses in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, offering strong conversational capabilities.
- **Framework**: [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) to integrate all components, simplifying RAG system development with abstractions for LLMs, vector stores, and embedding models.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Python's `argparse` module to create a user-friendly CLI that accepts a codebase path, indexes the codebase, and allows querying the agent.

The tool will enable users to run commands like `index_codebase --path /path/to/codebase` to index a codebase and `query_codebase "What does function X do?"` to interact with the agent, ensuring flexibility across programming languages and codebase structures.

## Validation of the Approach

The tech stack was validated for compatibility, performance, and ease of use, with additional consideration for command-line functionality:

- **OpenAI Embedding Model**: OpenAI's embeddings (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002) are effective for semantic search across various data types, including code. While code-specific models like Jina Code Embeddings V2 exist, OpenAI's model is general-purpose, well-documented, and supports diverse codebases, as shown in its performance on semantic tasks ([OpenAI Embeddings v3](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/openai-embeddings-v3/)).
- **Pinecone DB**: Pinecone is optimized for high-dimensional vector storage and semantic search, with a Python SDK that simplifies indexing and querying. It supports OpenAI embeddings and scales for large codebases ([OpenAI Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/vector_databases/pinecone/using_pinecone_for_embeddings_search)).
- **Claude as LLM**: Claude's conversational and reasoning capabilities make it ideal for RAG systems, generating context-aware responses for codebase queries. It integrates with LangChain for seamless operation ([Pinecone Examples](https://github.com/pinecone-io/examples/blob/master/learn/generation/langchain/v1/claude-3-agent.ipynb)).
- **LangChain Framework**: LangChain supports flexible file loading (e.g., via `TextLoader` or `DirectoryLoader`) and RAG system development, making it suitable for a command-line tool that processes arbitrary codebase paths.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Python's `argparse` is a standard library for building CLIs, offering simplicity and flexibility. Combined with recursive directory traversal (e.g., via `os.walk`), it enables the tool to index any codebase directory, handling various file types and structures.

## Status

Proposed

## Example Implementation

Below is a sample Python script for the command-line tool, demonstrating indexing and querying functionality. This script is a starting point and can be extended for production use.

```python
import os
import argparse
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader, TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone
from langchain.llms import Anthropic
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
import pinecone

# Initialize API keys (replace with your keys)
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your-anthropic-api-key"
os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"] = "your-pinecone-api-key"
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT = "your-pinecone-environment"

def index_codebase(codebase_path, index_name="codebase-index"):
    """Index a codebase given its path."""
    # Initialize Pinecone
    pinecone.init(api_key=os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"], environment=PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT)

    # Load and chunk codebase
    loader = DirectoryLoader(codebase_path, glob="**/*.[py,js,java,cpp]", loader_cls=TextLoader)
    documents = loader.load()
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
    docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

    # Generate and store embeddings
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    Pinecone.from_documents(docs, embeddings, index_name=index_name)
    print(f"Indexed codebase at {codebase_path} to Pinecone index {index_name}")

def query_codebase(query, index_name="codebase-index"):
    """Query the indexed codebase."""
    # Initialize Pinecone
    pinecone.init(api_key=os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"], environment=PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT)

    # Set up retriever and LLM
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vectorstore = Pinecone.from_existing_index(index_name, embeddings)
    llm = Anthropic(model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229")
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
        llm=llm,
        chain_type="stuff",
        retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),
        return_source_documents=True
    )

    # Execute query
    result = qa_chain({"query": query})
    print("Response:", result["result"])
    print("Source Documents:", [doc.metadata for doc in result["source_documents"]])

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Command-line tool for indexing and querying codebases")
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest="command")

    # Index command
    index_parser = subparsers.add_parser("index", help="Index a codebase")
    index_parser.add_argument("--path", required=True, help="Path to the codebase directory")
    index_parser.add_argument("--index-name", default="codebase-index", help="Pinecone index name")

    # Query command
    query_parser = subparsers.add_parser("query", help="Query the indexed codebase")
    query_parser.add_argument("--query", required=True, help="Query string")
    query_parser.add_argument("--index-name", default="codebase-index", help="Pinecone index name")

    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.command == "index":
        index_codebase(args.path, args.index_name)
    elif args.command == "query":
        query_codebase(args.query, args.index_name)
    else:
        parser.print_help()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script:
- Defines a CLI with `index` and `query` commands.
- Uses `DirectoryLoader` to recursively load code files from the specified path, supporting common extensions (`.py`, `.js`, `.java`, `.cpp`).
- Indexes the codebase by chunking files, generating embeddings, and storing them in Pinecone.
- Queries the index using a RAG system with Claude, returning responses and source documents.

Usage example:
```bash
python codebase_tool.py index --path /path/to/codebase --index-name my-codebase
python codebase_tool.py query --query "What does the authenticate_user function do?" --index-name my-codebase
```

## Performance and Scalability Considerations

- **Chunking Strategy**: A chunk size of ~500 characters balances context and retrieval efficiency. Language-specific parsers (e.g., ASTs) can improve chunking for code.
- **Retrieval Efficiency**: Pinecone's namespaces and metadata filtering enable faster queries by partitioning data (e.g., by file type or module).
- **Scalability**: Pinecone's serverless architecture supports millions of vectors. Batch processing for embeddings reduces API costs.
- **Benchmarking**: Evaluate retrieval accuracy with cosine similarity or recall@k. Use developer feedback to assess response quality.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: Encrypt sensitive code before embedding and configure Pinecone's access controls (e.g., API key restrictions). Verify compliance with data protection regulations.
- **API Security**: Store API keys in environment variables or a secrets manager. Use HTTPS for API calls.
- **Proprietary Code**: Use Pinecone's enterprise features (e.g., SOC2 compliance) for proprietary codebases.

## Alternative Approaches

- **Embedding Models**: Code-specific models like Jina Code Embeddings V2 or CodeRankEmbed may improve code-specific performance but require more setup than OpenAI.
- **Vector Databases**: Weaviate or FAISS are open-source alternatives but lack Pinecone's managed scalability.
- **LLMs**: GPT-4 or LLaMA (research-only) could replace Claude, but Claude's RAG compatibility and safety features are advantageous.
- **CLI Frameworks**: `click` or `typer` could replace `argparse` for more advanced CLI features, but `argparse` is sufficient and built-in.

The chosen stack balances performance, ease of use, and scalability for a command-line tool.

## Conclusion

This updated ADR outlines a command-line tool for indexing any codebase using OpenAI's embedding model, Pinecone DB, and Claude, integrated via LangChain. The CLI accepts a codebase path, supports diverse programming languages, and enables semantic search and context-aware responses. The phased implementation ensures manageability, while the validated tech stack with robust SDKs facilitates efficient development. Despite costs and dependencies, the solution's flexibility, scalability, and ease of use make it ideal for enterprise applications as of April 18, 2025.
