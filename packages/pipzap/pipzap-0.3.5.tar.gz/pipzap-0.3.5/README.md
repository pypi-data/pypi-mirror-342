> Zap the mess out of the dependency jungles

## Overview

PipZap is a command-line tool designed to optimize Python dependency management by pruning redundant dependencies, and easing the transition to the modern formats.

It processes a dependency file, such as `requirements.txt`, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)'s or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)'s `pyproject.toml`, and outputs a minimal list of direct dependencies, removing those satisfied transitively.

Leveraging [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency resolution, PipZap ensures your dependency list is lean and functional, making it easier to maintain and integrate into modern workflows.

## Why PipZap?

Python dependency management can be a mess, especially with scientific libraries where outdated practices persist. Projects (even recent ones) often ship with a `requirements.txt` generated by `pip freeze`, leaving you with a sprawling list of pinned dependencies, many of which are redundant.

Take the [easy_ViTPose](https://github.com/JunkyByte/easy_ViTPose) project as an example: its [requirements.txt](https://github.com/JunkyByte/easy_ViTPose/blob/main/requirements.txt) lists **50** packages, including transitive dependencies like `certifi` and `numpy`.

> See [below](#pruning-requirementstxt-from-easy_vitpose) for a real example with `easy_VitPose`

PipZap can transform this into a concise, modern format such as [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry), [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), or even a good old `requirements.txt` with just the essential direct dependencies. This makes it much easier to
adopt any package into a modern codebase.

Moreover, even in well-maintained codebases, accidental over-specification creeps in, and PipZap cuts through that noise, keeping your dependency list clean and intentional.

## Features

- **Dependency Pruning**: Eliminates redundant dependencies satisfied transitively.
- **Format Auto-Detection**: Automatically recognizes `requirements.txt`, `uv`, and `Poetry` files.
- **Flexible Output**: Outputs in `requirements`, `poetry`, or `uv` formats.
- **Python Version Handling**: Extracts from `pyproject.toml` or accepts via CLI for `requirements.txt`.
- **Isolated Resolution**: Resolves dependencies in a temporary, isolated environment to avoid impacting your project.
- **Verbose Logging**: Optional rich logging for detailed insights.

## Installation

Install PipZap with pip:

```bash
pip install pipzap
```

## Usage

Eliminate redundant dependencies from a file:

```bash
pipzap requirements.txt -p 3.11
pipzap pyproject.toml
pipzap pyproject.toml -o pruned.toml -f poetry -v
```

- Use `-p/--python-version` to specify (recommended; defaults to the current environment for `requirements.txt`).
- Python version is auto-detected from `pyproject.toml` when present.
- Output format defaults to the input format unless specified with `-f/--format` (e.g., `-f requirements`).

## Supported Formats

- **`requirements.txt`**: Pip-style with `--extra-index-url` support.
- **UV `pyproject.toml`**: Parses `[project.dependencies]` and `[project.requires-python]`.
- **Poetry `pyproject.toml`**: Handles `[project.dependencies]` (modern) and `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` (legacy).

## How It Works

1. **Parsing**: Identifies the file format and extracts direct dependencies.
2. **Resolution**: Uses `uv` to build the dependency graph in a temporary, isolated `pyproject.toml`.
3. **Pruning**: Identifies and removes transitive redundancies.
4. **Formatting**: Outputs the pruned dependencies in the specified format (`requirements`, `poetry`, or `uv`).

## Examples

### Pruning `requirements.txt` from `easy_ViTPose`

```

Command:

```bash
pipzap requirements.txt -p 3.11 -f poetry
```

Output (pruned to direct dependencies):

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
ffmpeg = "1.4"
filterpy = "1.4.5"
importlib-resources = "6.1.0"
lazy_loader = "0.3"
