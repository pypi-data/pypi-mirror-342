## 🧐 What is Digest Fusion Hashing?

Digest Fusion Hashing (DFH) is an innovative technique for creating ultra-secure hash digests by fusing the content digest with a randomized split of an internal secret signature.

This provides an **extremely high level of protection**, ensuring that even if attackers have access to the public hash, they cannot reconstruct the original content or secret without the original signature and split ratio.

---

## 📜 Features

- Combine two independent digests into a single final digest
- Randomized splitting ratio for maximum unpredictability
- Based on SHA3-512 cryptographic hashing
- Extremely lightweight: no external dependencies
- Designed for both integrity verification and authenticity validation
- Security-first architecture following Big Tech practices

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install digest-fusion-hashing
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

```python
from dfh.core import DigestFusionHasher

# Example data
content = b"your-data"
signature = b"your-secret-signature"

# Hashing
hasher = DigestFusionHasher()
result = hasher.hash(content, signature)

print("Final Hash:", result["final_hash"])
print("Split Ratio:", result["split_ratio"])
```
