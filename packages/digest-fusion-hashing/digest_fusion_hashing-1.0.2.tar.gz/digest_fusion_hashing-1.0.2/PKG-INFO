## 🧐 What is Digest Fusion Hashing?

Digest Fusion Hashing (DFH) is an innovative technique for creating ultra-secure hash digests by fusing the content digest with a randomized split of an internal secret signature.

This approach enhances protection, ensuring that even if attackers have access to the public hash, they cannot reconstruct the original content or secret without the original signature and split ratio.

---

## 📜 Features

- Combine two independent digests into a single final digest
- Randomized splitting ratio for maximum unpredictability
- Based on SHA3-512 cryptographic hashing
- Extremely lightweight: no external dependencies
- Designed for both integrity verification and authenticity validation
- Security-first architecture inspired by Big Tech standards

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install digest-fusion-hashing
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

```python
from dfh.core import DigestFusionHasher

# Example data
content = b"your-data"
signature = b"your-secret-signature"

# Hashing
hasher = DigestFusionHasher()
result = hasher.hash(content, signature)

print("Final Hash:", result["final_hash"])
print("Split Ratio:", result["split_ratio"])
```
