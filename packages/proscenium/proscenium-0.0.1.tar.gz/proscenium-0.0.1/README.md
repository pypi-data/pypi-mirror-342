Proscenium is a small, experimental library of composable glue that allows for
succinct construction of enterprise AI applications.  It is in early development.

It is also set of simple demonstration applications that elucidate aspects of application and library design.

Currently, proscenium development prioritizes support for domains where
the creation and use of structured data is critical.
