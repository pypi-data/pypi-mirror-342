# Animation Data Format

Animation data is the data format that is used to send avatar pose or animation data 
across animation related microservices. It is currently used to send animation data 
from an animation source (e.g. Audio2Face microservice) to an animation compositor 
(e.g. Animation Graph microservice) and from there to a renderer (e.g. the Omniverse 
Renderer microservice). The format can hold a single avatar pose frame with the 
corresponding audio or an entire animation sequence with corresponding audio. 

In the future this format might get extended to support camera poses, etc.
