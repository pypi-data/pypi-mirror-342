Here, we present PseudoChecker2, a command-line version of the web-tool PseudoChecker with expanded functions. It identifies gene loss via drastic mutational events such as premature stop codons, deletions and insertions. It enables the investigation of cross-species genomic datasets through: (i) integration into automated workflows, (ii) multiprocessing capability, and (iii) creation of a functional reference from annotation files. In addition, we introduce PseudoViz, a novel graphical interface designed to help interpret the results of PseudoChecker2 with intuitive visualizations. These tools combine the versatility and automation of a command-line tool with the user-friendliness of a graphical interface to tackle the challenges of the Genome Era.",bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.11.648399v1?rss=1
2025-04-21 20:39,Challenges in predicting protein-protein interactions of understudied viruses: Arenavirus-Human interactions,"Understanding protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between viruses and human proteins is crucial for uncovering infection mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets. The ability to generalize PPI predictive models across understudied viruses presents a significant challenge. In this work, we use arenavirus-human PPIs to illustrate the difficulties associated with model generalization, which are compounded by a lack of both positive and negative data. We employ a Transfer Learning approach to investigate arenavirus-human PPI by utilizing models trained on better-studied virus-human and human-human interactions. Additionally, we curate and assess four types of negative sampling datasets to evaluate their impact on model performance. Despite the overall high accuracies (93-99%) and AUPRC scores (0.8-0.9) appearing promising, further analysis indicates that these performance metrics can be misleading due to data leakage, data bias, and overfitting, especially concerning under-represented viral proteins. We reveal these gaps and assess the impact of data imbalance through standard k-fold cross-validation and Independent Blind Testing with a Balanced Dataset, leading to a drop in accuracy below 50%. We propose a viral protein-specific evaluation framework that groups viral proteins into majority and minority classes based on their representation in the dataset, allowing for comparison of model performance across these groups using balanced accuracies. This framework offers a more robust evaluation of model generalizability, addressing biases inherent in standard evaluation techniques and paving the way for more reliable PPI prediction models for understudied viruses.",bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.16.649136v1?rss=1
2025-04-21 20:39,Knowledge-driven annotation for gene interaction enrichment analysis,"Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a cornerstone for interpreting gene expression data, yet traditional approaches overlook gene interactions by focusing solely on individual genes, limiting their ability to detect subtle or complex pathway signals. To overcome this, we present GREA (Gene Interaction Enrichment Analysis), a novel framework that incorporates gene interaction data into enrichment analysis. GREA replaces the binary gene hit indicator with an interaction overlap ratio, capturing the degree of overlap between gene sets and gene interactions to enhance sensitivity and biological interpretability. It supports three enrichment metrics: Enrichment Score (ES), Enrichment Score Difference (ESD) from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov-based statistic, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) from a recovery curve. GREA evaluates statistical significance using both permutation testing and gamma distribution modeling. Benchmarking on transcriptomic datasets related to respiratory viral infections shows that GREA consistently outperforms existing tools such as blitzGSEA and GSEApy, identifying more relevant pathways with greater stability and reproducibility. By integrating gene interactions into pathway analysis, GREA offers a powerful and flexible tool for uncovering biologically meaningful insights in complex datasets.

2025-04-21 20:39,"Widespread discordance between mRNA expression, protein abundance and de novo lipogenesis activity in hepatocytes during the fed-starvation transition","The mammalian liver plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis during fasting and feeding. Liver function is further shaped by sex dimorphism and zonation of hepatocytes. To explore how these factors interact, we performed deep RNA-sequencing and label-free proteomics on periportal and pericentral hepatocytes isolated from male and female mice under fed and starved conditions. We developed a classification system to assess protein-mRNA relationship and found that gene products (mRNA or protein) for most zonation markers showed strong concordance between mRNA and protein. Although classical growth hormone regulated sex-biased gene products also exhibited concordance, ~60% of sex-biased gene products showed protein-level enrichment without corresponding mRNA differences. In contrast, transition between feeding and starvation triggered widespread changes in mRNA expression without significantly affecting protein levels. In particular, key lipogenic mRNAs (e.g. Acly, Acaca, and Fasn) were dramatically induced by feeding, but their corresponding proteins (ACLY, ACC1, and FAS) showed little to no change even as functional de novo lipogenic activity increased ~28-fold in the fed state. To facilitate further exploration of these findings, we developed Discorda (https://shinoda-lab.shinyapps.io/discorda/), a web database for interactive analysis. Our findings reinforce the principle that mRNA changes do not reliably predict corresponding protein levels (and vice versa), particularly in the context of sex and acute metabolic regulation of hepatocytes, and that de novo lipogenesis activity can be completely uncoupled from changes in protein expression.",bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.15.649020v1?rss=1
2025-04-21 20:39,Topography Aware Optimal Transport for Alignment of Spatial Omics Data,"Understanding the spatial organization of tissues is essential for uncovering cellular communication, developmental processes, and disease mechanisms. Recent advances in spatial omics technologies have provided unprecedented insight into tissue spatial organization, but challenges remain in aligning spatial slices and integrating complementary single-cell and spatial data. Here, we propose TOAST (Topography-aware Optimal Alignment of Spatially-resolved Tissues), a novel OT-based framework that extends the classical Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) objective to more comprehensively model the heterogeneity of local molecular interactions. By introducing spatial coherence, quantified through the entropy of local neighborhoods, and neighborhood consistency, which preserves the expression profiles of neighboring spots, TOAST's objective function significantly improves the alignment of spatially resolved tissue slices and the mapping between single-cell and spatial data. Through comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world datasets, including human brain cortex Visium data, Axolotl brain Stereo-seq data, mouse embryo seqFISH data, and Imaging Mass Cytometry from multiple cancer types, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional FGW and other OT-based alignment methods. Specifically, TOAST improves the accuracy of spatial slice alignment, better preserves cell type compositions, recovers lineage trajectories in developmental brain data, and reconstructs spatial relationships in spatial transcriptomics mouse embryo data. By integrating spatial constraints into OT, our framework provides a principled approach to enhance the biological interpretability of spatially resolved omics data and facilitate multimodal data integration.",bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.15.648894v1?rss=1
2025-04-21 20:39,"Accelerated, Accurate, Hybrid Short and Long Reads Alignment and Variant Calling","Background: Integrating short-read and long-read sequencing technologies has become a promising approach for achieving accurate and comprehensive genomic analysis. While short-read sequencing (Illumina, etc.) offers high base accuracy and cost efficiency, it struggles with structural variation (SV) detection and complex genomic regions. In contrast, long-read sequencing (PacBio HiFi) excels in resolving large SVs and repetitive sequences but is limited by throughput, higher error rates (especially Indels), and sequencing costs. Hybrid approaches may combine these technologies and leverage their complementary strengths and different sources of error to provide higher accuracy, more comprehensive results, and higher throughput by lowering the coverage requirement for the long reads. Methods: This study benchmarks the DNAscope Hybrid pipeline, a novel integrated alignment and variant calling framework that combines short- and long-read data sequenced from the same sample. We evaluate its performance across multiple human genome reference datasets (HG002-HG004) using the draft Q100 and Genome in a Bottle v4.2.1 benchmarks. The pipeline's ability to detect small variants (SNPs/Indels), structural variants (SVs), and copy number variations (CNVs) is assessed using data from the Illumina and Pacbio sequencing systems at varying read depths (5x-30x). Benchmark results are compared to DeepVariant. Results: The DNAscope Hybrid pipeline significantly improves SNP and Indel calling accuracy, particularly in complex genomic regions. At lower long-read depths (e.g., 5x-10x), the hybrid approach outperforms standalone short- or long-read pipelines at full sequencing depths (30x-35x). Additionally, the DNAscope Hybrid outperforms leading open-source tools for SV and CNV detection, enhancing variant discovery in challenging genomic regions. The pipeline also demonstrates clinical utility by identifying disease-associated variants. Moreover, DNAscope Hybrid is highly efficient, achieving less than 90 minutes runtimes at single standard instance. Conclusion: The DNAscope Hybrid pipeline is a computationally efficient, highly accurate variant calling framework that leverages the advantages of both short- and long-read sequencing. By improving variant detection in challenging genomic regions and offering a robust solution for clinical and large-scale genomic applications, it holds significant promise for genetic disease diagnostics, population-scale studies, and personalized medicine.",bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.15.648987v1?rss=1
2025-04-21 20:39,Harmonizing Heterogeneous Single-Cell Gene Expression Data with Individual-Level Covariate Information,"The growing availability of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data highlights the necessity for robust integration methods to uncover both shared and unique cellular features across samples. These datasets often exhibit technical variations and biological differences, complicating integrative analyses. While numerous integration methods have been proposed, many fail to account for individual-level covariates or are limited to discrete variables. To address these limitations, we propose scINSIGHT2, a generalized linear latent variable model that accommodates both continuous covariates, such as age, and discrete factors, such as disease conditions. Through both simulation studies and real-data applications, we demonstrate that scINSIGHT2 accurately harmonizes scRNA-seq datasets, whether from single or multiple sources. These results highlight scINSIGHT2's utility in capturing meaningful biological insights from scRNA-seq data while accounting for individual-level variation. The scINSIGHT2 method has been implemented as an R package, which is available at https://github.com/yudimu/scINSIGHT2/.",bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.15.649009v1?rss=1
2025-04-21 20:39,Facilitating genome annotation using ANNEXA and long-read RNA sequencing,"With the advent of complete genome assemblies, genome annotation has become essential for the functional interpretation of genomic data. Long-read RNA sequencing (LR-RNAseq) technologies have significantly improved transcriptome annotation by enabling full-length transcript reconstruction for both coding and non-coding RNAs. However, challenges such as transcript fragmentation and incomplete isoform representation persist, highlighting the need for robust quality control (QC) strategies. This study presents an updated version of ANNEXA, a pipeline designed to enhance genome annotation using LR-RNAseq data while also providing QC for reconstructed genes and transcripts. ANNEXA integrates two transcriptome reconstruction tools, StringTie2 and Bambu, applying stringent filtering criteria to improve annotation accuracy. It also incorporates deep learning models to evaluate transcription start sites (TSSs) and employs the tool FEELnc for the systematic annotation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Additionally, the pipeline offers intuitive visualizations for comparative analyses of coding and non-coding repertoires. Benchmarking against multiple reference annotations revealed distinct patterns of sensitivity and precision for both known and novel genes and transcripts and mRNAs and lncRNAs. To demonstrate its utility, ANNEXA was applied in a comparative oncology study involving LR-RNAseq of two human and eight canine cancer cell lines. The pipeline successfully identified novel genes and transcripts across species, expanding the catalog of protein-coding and lncRNA annotations in both species. Implemented in Nextflow for scalability and reproducibility, ANNEXA is available as an open-source tool: https://github.com/IGDRion/ANNEXA.",bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.16.648718v1?rss=1
2025-04-21 20:39,Fast and accessible morphology-free functional fluorescence imaging analysis,"Optical calcium imaging is a powerful tool for recording neural activity across a wide range of spatial scales, from dendrites and spines to whole-brain imaging through two-photon and widefield microscopy. Traditional methods for analyzing functional calcium imaging data rely heavily on spatial features, such as the compact shapes of somas, to extract regions of interest and their associated temporal traces. This spatial dependency can introduce biases in time trace estimation and limit the applicability of these methods across different neuronal morphologies and imaging scales. To address these limitations, the Graph Filtered Temporal Dictionary Learning (GraFT) uses a graph-based approach to identify neural components based on shared temporal activity rather than spatial proximity, enhancing generalizability across diverse datasets. Here we present significant advancements to the GraFT algorithm, including the integration of a more efficient solver for the L1 least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) problem and the application of compressive sensing techniques to reduce computational complexity. By employing random projections to reduce data dimensionality, we achieve substantial speedups while maintaining analytical accuracy. These advancements significantly accelerate the GraFT algorithm, making it more scalable for larger and more complex datasets. Moreover, to increase accessibility, we developed a graphical user interface to facilitate running and analyzing the outputs of GraFT. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of GraFT to imaging data beyond meso-scale imaging, including vascular and axonal imaging.",bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.15.648462v1?rss=1

Findings To address these challenges, we developed a flexible and scalable genome annotation pipeline that integrates short-read (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio) sequencing technologies. The pipeline combines reference-based and de novo assembly methods, effectively handling genomic variability and alternative splicing events. Functional annotation is conducted to filter out low-confidence transcripts and ensure biological relevance. Applying this pipeline to the asexual strain of S. mediterranea revealed thousands of previously undescribed putative genes and transcripts, and improved the existing gene models, highlighting its utility in annotating complex, underexplored genomes. Conclusions The modularity and comprehensiveness of our pipeline ensure its adaptability for genome annotation across diverse species, making it a valuable tool for annotating genomes of non-model organisms and supporting broader genomic research.

Here, we report IgHuAb, a large language model for high-throughput generation of paired human antibody sequences. Using IgHuAb, we created SynAbLib, a synthetic human antibody library that mimics population-level features of naturally occurring human antibody sequences, yet is associated with significantly greater diversity in sequence space. Further, experimental validation of a diverse set of antibodies from SynAbLib showed robust expression yields. IgHuAb and SynAbLib provide a readily expandable platform for human monoclonal antibody generation that can be efficiently mined for antibody sequences with target properties.",PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258041/

While several ongoing efforts are aimed at improving microbiome data management, significant gaps still remain in terms of defining and promoting adoption of consensus standards for these datasets. The Strengthening the Organization and Reporting of Microbiome Studies (STORMS) guidelines for human microbiome research have been endorsed and successfully utilized by many research organizations, publishers, and funding agencies, and have been recognized as a consensus community standard. No equivalent effort has occurred for environmental, synthetic, and non-human host-associated microbiomes. To address this growing need within the microbiome research community, we convened the Microbiome Data Management in Action Workshop (June 12-13, 2024, in Atlanta, GA, USA), to bring together key decision makers in microbiome science including researchers, publishers, funders, and data repositories. The 50 attendees, representing the diverse and interdisciplinary nature of microbiome research, discussed recent progress and challenges, and brainstormed actionable recommendations and paths forward for coordinated environmental microbiome data management and the modifications necessary for the STORMS guidelines to be applied to environmental, non-human host, and synthetic microbiomes. The outcomes of this workshop will form the basis of a formalized data management roadmap to be implemented across the field.

2025-04-21 20:39,Liquid Biopsy on Microfluidics: From Existing Endogenous to Emerging Exogenous Biomarkers Analysis.,"Liquid biopsy is an appealing approach for early diagnosis and assessment of treatment efficacy in cancer. Typically, liquid biopsy involves the detection of endogenous biomarkers, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA), and proteins. The levels of these endogenous biomarkers are higher in cancer patients compared to those in healthy individuals. However, the clinical application of liquid biopsy using endogenous biomarker analysis faces challenges due to its low abundance and poor stability in circulation. Recently, a promising strategy involving the engineering of exogenous probes has been developed to overcome these limitations. These exogenous probes are activated within the tumor microenvironment, generating distinct exogenous markers that can be easily distinguished from background biological signals. Alternatively, these exogenous probes can be labeled with intrinsic endogenous biomarkers in vivo and detected in vitro after metabolic processes. In this review, we primarily focus on microfluidic-based liquid biopsy techniques that allow for the transition from analyzing existing endogenous biomarkers to emerging exogenous ones. First, we introduce common endogenous biomarkers, as well as synthetic exogenous ones. Next, we discuss recent advancements in microfluidic-based liquid biopsy techniques for analyzing both existing endogenous and emerging exogenous biomarkers. Lastly, we provide insights into future directions for liquid biopsy on microfluidic systems.",PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40247704/
2025-04-21 20:39,Fundamental Trade-Offs in the Robustness of Biological Systems with Feedback Regulation.,"Natural biological systems use feedback regulation to effectively respond and adapt to their changing environment. Even though in engineered systems we understand how accurate feedback can be depending on the electronic or mechanical parts that it is implemented with, we largely lack a similar theoretical framework to study feedback regulation in biological systems. Specifically, it is not fully understood or quantified how accurate or robust the implementation of biological feedback actually is. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of biological feedback to variations in biochemical parameters using five example circuits: positive autoregulation, negative autoregulation, double-positive feedback, positive-negative feedback, and double-negative feedback (the toggle switch). We find that some of these examples of biological feedback are subjected to fundamental performance trade-offs, and we propose multi-objective optimization as a framework to study their properties. The impact of this work is to improve robust circuit design for synthetic biology and to improve our understanding of feedback for systems biology.",PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40198741/
2025-04-21 20:39,Statistical signature of subtle behavioral changes in large-scale assays.,"The central nervous system can generate various behaviors, including motor responses, which we can observe through video recordings. Recent advances in gene manipulation, automated behavioral acquisition at scale, and machine learning enable us to causally link behaviors to their underlying neural mechanisms. Moreover, in some animals, such as the Drosophila melanogaster larva, this mapping is possible at the unprecedented scale of single neurons, allowing us to identify the neural microcircuits generating particular behaviors. These high-throughput screening efforts, linking the activation or suppression of specific neurons to behavioral patterns in millions of animals, provide a rich dataset to explore the diversity of nervous system responses to the same stimuli. However, important challenges remain in identifying subtle behaviors, including immediate and delayed responses to neural activation or suppression, and understanding these behaviors on a large scale. We here introduce several statistically robust methods for analyzing behavioral data in response to these challenges: 1) A generative physical model that regularizes the inference of larval shapes across the entire dataset. 2) An unsupervised kernel-based method for statistical testing in learned behavioral spaces aimed at detecting subtle deviations in behavior. 3) A generative model for larval behavioral sequences, providing a benchmark for identifying higher-order behavioral changes. 4) A comprehensive analysis technique using suffix trees to categorize genetic lines into clusters based on common action sequences.

Here, we introduce a complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting approach for designing nanobodies (Nbs) that target specific epitopes, with the aid of computer simulation and machine learning. As a proof-of-concept, we designed, evaluated, and characterized a high-affinity Nb against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The designed Nb, referred to as Nb Ab.2, was synthesized and displayed high-affinity for both the purified receptor-binding domain protein and to the virus-like particle, demonstrating affinities of 9 nM and 60 nM, respectively, as measured with microscale thermophoresis. Circular dichroism showed the designed protein's structural integrity and its proper folding, whereas molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into the internal dynamics of Nb Ab.2.

Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches have gained prominence in genomic prediction (GP). Here, we introduce a novel DL framework for GP based on Elastic Net feature selection and bidirectional encoder representations from transformer's embedding and multi-head attention pooling (EBMGP). EBMGP applies Elastic Net for the selection of features, thereby diminishing the computational burden and bolstering the predictive accuracy. In EBMGP, SNPs are treated as ""words,"" and groups of adjacent SNPs with similar LD levels are considered ""sentences."" By applying bidirectional encoder representations from transformers embeddings, this method models SNPs in a manner analogous to human language, capturing complex genetic interactions at both the ""word"" and ""sentence"" scales. This flexible representation seamlessly integrates into any DL network and demonstrates a marked improvement in predictive performance for EBMGP and SoyDNGP compared to the widely used one-hot representation. We propose multi-head attention pooling, which can adaptively assign weights to features while learning features from multiple subspaces through multi-heads for a high level of semantic understanding. In a comprehensive comparative analysis across four diverse plant and animal datasets, EBMGP outperformed competing models in 13 out of 16 tasks, achieving accuracy gains ranging from 0.74 to 9.55% over the second-best model. These results underscore EBMGP's robustness in genomic prediction and highlight its potential for deep learning applications in life sciences.",PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40253568/

2025-04-21 20:39,"Integrative analysis of signaling and metabolic pathways, immune infiltration patterns, and machine learning-based diagnostic model construction in major depressive disorder.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a multifactorial disorder involving genetic and environmental factors, with unclear pathogenesis. This study aims to explore the pathogenic pathway of MDD and its relationship with immune responses and to discover its potential targets by bioinformatics methods. We first applied gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and seven different immune infiltration algorithms to the GSE98793 dataset to determine the differences in signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, and immune cell infiltration between MDD patients and healthy controls. Differentially expressed genes between MDD patients and controls were obtained from five datasets (GSE98793, GSE32280, GSE38206, GSE39653, and GSE52790), and 113 machine learning methods were employed to construct MDD diagnostic models. Based on the constructed MDD diagnostic models, MDD patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. GSVA and immune microenvironment analyses were conducted to investigate the differences between the two groups. Furthermore, potential drugs and therapeutic targets for the high-risk MDD group were explored to provide new insights and directions for the precise treatment of MDD. GSVA and immune infiltration results indicate that patients with MDD exhibit differences from normal individuals in various aspects, including biological processes, signaling pathways, metabolic processes, and immune cells. To investigate the functions and biological significance of differentially expressed genes in MDD patients, we performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses on the differentially expressed genes from five databases (GSE98793, GSE32280, GSE38206, GSE39653, and GSE52790). By comparing the enrichment results across the five datasets, we found that the cell-killing signaling pathway was consistently present in the enriched signaling pathways of all datasets, suggesting that this pathway may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MDD. The random forest algorithm (AUC = 0.788) was selected as the optimal algorithm from 113 machine learning algorithms, leading to the development of a robust and predictive MDD algorithm, highlighting the important role of NPL in MDD. By dividing MDD into high and low-risk subgroups based on diagnostic model scores, enrichment pathways, and immunological results further demonstrated that high-risk MDD is associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, inflammation, and numbers of T cells and B cells. Through GSEA scoring, five upregulated pathways in the high-risk MDD group were identified, and multiple potential drugs such as Mibefradil, LY364947, ZLN005, STA- 5326, and vemurafenib were screened. Patients with MDD show differences in signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, and immune mechanisms. By constructing an MDD diagnostic model, we predicted the key genes of MDD and the characteristic pathways associated with a higher risk of MDD.

TRESOR enables highly accurate identification of target candidate proteins that counteract disease-specific transcriptome patterns, and the Bayesian optimization with omics-based disease similarities achieves the performance enhancement for diseases with few or no known targets. We make comprehensive predictions for 284 diseases with 4345 inhibitory target candidates and 151 diseases with 4040 activatory target candidates, and elaborate the promising targets using several independent cohorts. The methods are expected to be useful for understanding disease-disease relationships and identifying therapeutic targets for rare and orphan diseases.",MED,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40251160/
2025-04-21 20:39,Diagnostic MicroRNA Signatures to Support Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension.,"<h4>Background</h4>Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) are classified based on disease etiology and hemodynamic drivers. Classification informs treatment. The heart failure biomarker NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) is used to help inform risk but is not specific to PH or sub-classification groups. There are currently no other biomarkers in clinical use to help guide diagnosis or risk.<h4>Methods</h4>We profiled a retrospective cohort of 1150 patients from 3 expert centers with PH and 334 non-PH symptomatic controls (disease controls) from the United Kingdom to measure circulating levels of 650 microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum. NT-proBNP (ELISA) and 326 well-detected miRNAs (polymerase chain reaction) were prioritized by feature selection using multiple machine learning models. From the selected miRNAs, generalized linear models were used to describe miRNA signatures to differentiate PH and pulmonary arterial hypertension from the disease controls, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, PH due to left heart disease, PH due to lung disease, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension from other forms of PH. These signatures were validated on a UK test cohort and independently validated in the prospective CIPHER study (A Prospective, Multicenter, Noninterventional Study for the Identification of Biomarker Signatures for the Early Detection of Pulmonary Hypertension) comprising 349 patients with PH and 93 disease controls.<h4>Results</h4>NT-proBNP achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.74 and 0.75 at identifying PH and pulmonary arterial hypertension from disease controls with a threshold of 254 and 362 pg/mL, respectively but was unable to sub-categorize PH subgroups. In the UK cohort, miRNA signatures performed similarly to NT-proBNP in distinguishing PH (area under the curve of 0.7 versus 0.78), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (area under the curve of 0.73 versus 0.79) from disease controls. MicroRNA signatures outperformed NT-proBNP in distinguishing PH classification groups. External testing in the CIPHER cohort demonstrated that miRNA signatures, in conjunction with NT-proBNP, age, and sex, performed better than either NT-proBNP or miRNAs alone in sub-classifying PH.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We suggest a threshold for NT-proBNP to identify patients with a high probability of PH, and the subsequent use of circulating miRNA signatures to help differentiate PH subgroups.",MED,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40248872/
2025-04-21 20:39,A random forest-based predictive model for classifying BRCA1 missense variants: a novel approach for evaluating the missense mutations effect.,"The right classification of variants is the key to pre-symptomatic detection of disease and conducting preventive actions. Since BRCA1 has a high incidence and penetrance in breast and ovarian cancers, a high-performance predictive tool can be employed to classify the clinical significance of its variants. Several tools have previously been developed for this purpose which poorly classify the significance in specific cases. The proposed tools commonly assign a score without providing any interpretation behind it. To reach an accurate predictive tool with interpretation abilities, in this study, we propose BRCA1-Forest which works based on random forest as a well-known machine learning technique for making interpretable decisions with high specificity and sensitivity in variants classification. The method involves narrowing down available options until reaching the final decision. To this end, a set of BRCA1 benign and pathogenic missense variants was collected first, and then, the dataset was prepared based on the effect of each variant on the protein sequence. The dataset was enriched by adding physicochemical changes and the conservation score of the amino acid position as pathogenicity criteria. The proposed model was trained based on the dataset to classify the clinical significance of variants. The performance of BRCA1-Forest was compared to four state-of-the-art methods, SIFT, PolyPhen2, CADD, and DANN, in terms of different evaluation metrics including precision, recall, false positive rate (FPR), the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC ROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), and Mathew correlation coefficient (MCC). The results reveal that the proposed model outperforms the abovementioned tools in all metrics except for recall.
