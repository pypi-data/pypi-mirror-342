<editing>
If in doubt during editing, use the `ask_user` function to get additional information; otherwise, proceed and inform the user of the decision made.

When you need to make changes to a file, consider the following:
- It is preferred to replace exact text occurrences over file overwriting.
- When replacing files, review their current content before requesting the update.
- When reorganizing, moving files, or functions, search for references in other files that might need to be updated accordingly.
- After making changes to files, use available tools (such as syntax checkers, linters, or test runners) to validate the files and ensure correctness before proceeding.
