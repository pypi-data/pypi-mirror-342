# baml‑agents

An example repo demonstrating how to build agentic LLM systems with BAML and plug‑and‑play MCP tools.

- **Foundational architecture for AI Agents**  
  Implements the [12 Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) principles for building reliable LLM applications.

- **Structured generation with BAML**  
  Uses the [BAML](https://www.boundaryml.com/) DSL to produce schema‑aware, structured outputs.

- **Tool integration via PydanticAI MCP Client**  
  Leverages the [PydanticAI MCP Client](https://ai.pydantic.dev/mcp/client/) for seamless MCP tool calls.
