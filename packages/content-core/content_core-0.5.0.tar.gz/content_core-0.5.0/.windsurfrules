Also use uv as the package manager: uv run, uv sync, uv add.

All documentation (code or readmes) must be in english.
Whenever I ask you to tag and release, make sure to run `make test` as part of the process. 

The full release process is: 
- Run `make test` to make sure everything is working (if we changed any code or import)
- Update version on pyproject.toml
- Run `uv sync` to update the lock file
- Commit all that's needed
- Merge to main (if in a branch)
- Tag the release
- Push to GitHub
